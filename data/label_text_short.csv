1,Great Chemistry Book,"A little hard in some places for your average youngster, but does a great job of giving an overview of chemistry."
0,Hi! I MAKE NO SENSE!!...,That's what this DVD with a SPECIAL EDITION of THE CURSE OF FENRIC should be called...CHEESY...OVERWRITTEN...BORING...and why is the sound so bad?ACE is the best thing about the SYLVESTOR MCCOY episodes...cuz he certainly isn't...just DREADFUL and so re-written that the character of DOCTOR WHO becomes CONTRIVED and conventional which was something it never was before. The SYLVESTOR MCCOY years took all the fun out of DOCTOR WHO and turn it into drivel. This episode is TERRIBLE.It makes no sense...is badly edited and ridiculously over plotted. WHO CARES?!! Even DOCTOR WHO himself would not watch this eyesore!!
0,Had trouble downloading photos to computer,"This was a gift for my 5 1/2 year old. I agree with all about the view screen. Horrible quality. My daughter thought the pictures looked bad and deleted them. She loved taking photos and deleting them, kind of like a video game for her. Annoying sounds too each time you scroll through the photos or delete from the camera.I tried to download the photos after properly installing the software, but got a failure when opening the DCIM folder. Call customer support they said I needed to use a SD card to download photos to the computer. This is not what is described in the packgage. Customer support was to send me a fix for Vista, mine is 32 bit not 64 bit. Never received it."
1,amazing,this toy is great. Now teachers can see what really goes on when they are writing on the board. These glasses are also great for moms with little kids like under the age of five.
0,RAT RACE DVD,"I GOT THE CORRECT MOVIE BUT IT WILL NOT PLAY IN ANY OF MY DVD PLAYERS. ALL IT SAYS IN ALL OF THEM IS ""ERROR"". I AM NOT SURE WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT BUT I CANT GET IT TO PLAY."
0,NOT What I Ordered,"Wolfgang Puck recently changed their Chicken soup. The old stuff is excellent. The new stuff is watered down, not filling and doesn't taste as good. The image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup. The soup I received is the new stuff. Being a food item, returns are not allowed. I feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased."
1,Good Historical Fiction,"If you are looking for real historical fiction, NOT a ""historical"" romance novel and you are interested in the early church or the Roman Empire under the Julio-Claudian dynasty then read this book. It is well-written, thoroughly researched, and very enjoyable to read. I didn't give it 5 stars as I have liked some other novels set in ancient Rome better, but all in all this is a good book."
0,Don 't Buy This Lemon!,"I've bought this TV about two years ago and after less than one year it began to have video problems. The problem was intermittent at first but now it is almost constant. The black scenes are blotchy green and other colors are over saturated to the point where the picture becomes a blob of pixels. The TV screen is so hot that watching it in my bedroom during the summertime was not an option, so it really has been lightly used (I have two other bigger TVs.) The response to the remote control is so slow that you often wonder if you hit the right button. Even if I had purchased an extended warranty, I'd still have to cart the thing more than 60 miles to an authorized Hitachi repair center although I live less than 10 miles from a nice size metropolitan area. If I had to say anything nice, I'd say that when it works, the picture is great...but it stopped working after less than 500 hours of actual use...and that's a bit more important."
1,A really great product!,"We are a small non-profit organization and we were being besieged by unwanted emails. Besides the security issues, it was taking too much of our time deleting the unwanted mail to get to the mail that we really needed to respond to. When we installed iMailKeys it was such a relief. The program was so simple to install and learn. In less than an hour I had it downloaded, installed and running. It really does the job. Their customer service people were very helpful and responded quickly when I had a question. A good price, a great product and excellent customer service - I highly recommend this product."
0,"Not For Kindle, Table of Contents does not work","Unless you want to read one page at a time from beginning to end and not go to any specific poem, this book is ok. Otherwise don't buy!!"
0,not all weather product,"I ordered this product excited to see that it was all season protection even in hot climates. I have 3 dogs that i walk 4 miles a day on pavement and pads on one of their feet were getting thin and needed something to protect them, and why not add to all 3 dogs to prevent it from happening to them. Well i had each one lie down and applied 3 coats to their pads and had them stay down for ten minutes. When i let them up I had waxy paw prints all over the ground, glad i did this outside and not in my house! Think when wax gets hot what does it do-melt of course, so they need to take the all year protection off the description. We don't get snow very often here, but if it does I will try to put it on their paws then and see if it works then. So if u buy this don't use it in warm or hot temperatures. Can't rate it on the cold weather."
0,"Barney, what happened?","My 2 year old grandson adores Barney, but this CD left him cold. He'll listen to it for a few minutes and then wants nothing to do with it. He sings his ABC songs all day and loves to count, so I thought this would be a big hit. He couldn't get enough of another Barney CD, so I'm disappointed that this one didn't work out."
0,don't bother if you have a laptop and windows,"This is my first Apple experience and what a disaster.The IPOD itself is very nice, but to use it you need a windows installation and from what I have learned so far, if you have a laptop, you're up a creek. Apple has not support/warranty to speak of so you are on your own. Blue screen of death, spontaneous reboot, probably another $50 for a firewire card that might fix things, and no idea , no FAQ, no nothing at apple to help. This is like dealing with Microsoft."
1,Very good value for the money,I built a two-story cage for my ferret with two of these cages connected by a flexible tube. Hard to beat in terms of value for the money.
1,You just HAVE to like it,"That being said,I -however unjustified my reasons may be- love this album, and would like to encourage everyone to give it a try. In order to keep this review short, I'd like to mention some things I've noticed. Jon Brion plays a pretty important part in the production. I won't lie, Sean's album would sound fairly hollow if it weren't for the beautiful composure and steady hand of Brion. Meaningless is Brion's album, and would also like to encourage people to listen to that underrated masterpiece. Lastly, the Beatles influence is very prominent on certain tracks... an example being ""Wait For Me"", which is essentially ""I'm Only Sleeping"" with different lyrics."
0,Nothing to SMiLE about here,"Like the others who have reviewed this book, I have a long time interest in Brian Wilson, and the Beach Boys. I have read a great deal about them, already. Much of what I have read is very good, especially Timothy White's book.However, like so many others, I was delighted to see SMiLE finally completed, and - no matter what I have already read - I felt that this book promised to be a 'straight-from-the-horses-mouths' chronology of the once-thought impossible chain of events that resulted in the release of this fabled album.Boy, was I ever wrong about that!How does self-important, psycho-babble art-speak like this ever actually see its way into print?Are there no book editors, anymore?If you are looking for the real, professionally written, competent, clear, insightful, and historically accurate story of SMiLE...well...like the rest of us, you'll have to look elsewhere."
1,Dissecting Harold Lloyd comedies,"Donald McCaffrey, a film professor from Iowa, has extensively studied three of Harold Lloyd's great silent films: GRANDMA'S BOY, THE FRESHMAN, and SAFETY LAST. McCaffrey walks the reader through the different portions of each film such as the exposition and climax. He shows how Lloyd develops sight gags and how the latter two films are better than GRANDMA'S BOY. This book also covers Lloyd's early and later career. An appendix of the book includes the author's conversations with Lloyd about Lloyd's career. This book is a ""must-have"" for Harold Lloyd fans and readers interested in how silent film comedy works."
0,Wish I had read the reviews,This is a piece of junk. Wish I had read the reviews. What is worse is the Netgear support. Total waste of time. At least I have been able to get through to Dlink and Linksys. Based on the poor support I will never consider another Netgear product.
1,The most important book on Earth,"For those of us, who don't only like to search but also to find, this is the most important book on Earth!"
0,Disappointed,"The concept of this harness is quite brilliant. It really does decrease the amount of pulling but the harness doesn't sit straight. If the dog pulls at all the harness shifts, it gets under the dogs front legs and begins to chaffe (spelling?) him. I've tried adjusting it quite often but it never seems to work. I gave it an honest weeks trial before I threw it with the other piece of crap harnesses I've tried. The best ones are the simple attach in the back ones in my opinion."
1,Great movie,Excellent film! Great cast! This movie tells the story of the first Black Army Corp fighter pilots and the struggles they had to get the right to fight for their country. The abilities of this outstanding group of men made them sought after as escorts by some of the very men who rejected them because of the color of their skin.

These are not designed with teeth to grip parts, instead designed not to leave teeth marks in everything your trying to hold.Good quality made by Wilton.RagenRat :0)"
0,Don't like this book,I don't like this book at all. Too many lines but not enough substance. Better off using chess opening database.
1,When fine sanding's a must...,"This is the best in the biz. The missus and I used to run a little taxidermy shop down in Coos Bay. When customers couldn't pay, which happens more often than you'd think even when a loved pet is involved, we'd fashion lamps or tables or knick knacks out of them. The problem is no one wants a curio table that's a gonna shed all over the place. So we'd fine sand the hair down to bristle length. Took us FOREVER to fine a sander with variable speed that went low enough so as not to pull the hairs out by the follicle. But this little beauty here did the trick. First attracted to it by its name, we've come to find it irreplaceable. Whether it's a barking dog umbrella holder or moose knuckle pendulum klick klack balls, this is definitely the sander of choice for the artisan who works in organics."
0,"Way, way diluted -- not resemble photo","Take the citra-solv in the photo (the orange citra-solv we fell in love with), fill a bottle one-third with it, then add 2/3 water and voila -- the current citra-solve. WAY WAY more diluted. Not even orange as in the photo but a pale yellow. Shame on you, Citra-solve."
0,Over the edge of tolerance,"Pretty bad. If I hadn't been busy laughing at it, I would have been busy barfing because of it."
1,"Good Access Point, working fine for me","I'm Not sure why so many other reviewers are having problems with their WAP51AB, but it's working fine for me. Setup was simple, it came with good documentation/setup instructions. The default IP address wasn't appropriate for my network, but that was easy to change and I had this access point up and running in 10 minutes. I was able to setup two separate SSID's (one for 802.11a and one for 802.11b) and configure WEP for both a & b. It was also easy to add MAC address filtering.I have had this access point for about 1 week and haven't had any problems staying connected to 802.11a as others have complained about. The range on the 'a' channel is not nearly as good as 'b', but the extra speed is great! When i'm sitting close to the AP (< 20ft), I use 'a' and when I'm farther away, i switch to 'b'.My only complaint is that the range of the 'a' channel isn't that great, but other than that, this AP works fine."
0,Different,"Size chart doesn't seem to include socks! My pair fits good barefoot, but not with socks. If you need to wear socks with them, go up a size. The sole is rounded slightly so is not that great for balance postures. I use, but probably won't purchase another pair."
1,Great Product,"I don't know how this product has received such negative ratings because my household has used it for a long time with no problems. We live in Hawaii where it can be quite dusty. You can clean a table and find a layer of dust the next day. What we do is we run the device while we are away. Of course, you have have to allow the ionized air to dissipate afterwards. That means if you run it for two hours you will allow it to sit for several hours before entering the premises. I think that some users were not giving it enough time to settle. Also, some users may have used it while IN the room which is not a good idea. Ours has lasted for a years with no problems. We like it so much that we got a second one for the living room (the first one was used exclusively in the bedroom where the dust seemed especially be a problem). Both units were bought used, by the way."
0,HORRIBLE STOMACH PAIN!!,I have Celiac Disease and heard so much good stuff about Hemp Seeds. I purchased this 3lb. bag and was excited to try it. The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds. The next time I sprinkled it on my salad. Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting. It was so awful! I was in pain the whole night. I was afraid to eat anything the next day. I just had Gatorade and a banana. I don't think I could ever try Hemp Seeds again. I don't know if this was a bad batch or if they share equipment with a wheat facility. I will never buy this again.
1,Fast Memory,"Memory, is really fast on my Hp laptop, it was very easy to install.The package it came in was strong and secure, Increased performance with Windows apps."
0,I'm sorry I bought it,"I haven't made it past the fifth chapter in the book and I honestly dread picking it up again. Reading the the reviews and description before buying, I did not realize this book is a pastiche, not a genre I typically choose. Maybe I just don't ""get"" it. I think Austin Powers is funny, but film makes it easier to pick up the tone. I feel like The Vesuvius Club misses, it just seems like bad writing, not deliberate humor."
1,"Lionel Magic ""review"".","Very Satisfied with DVD. Quite a bit of model train film bang for the buck. The human stories relating to the hobby and the train info/action both have appeal. Most movies I see I don't watch more than once, but i've enjoyed watching this DVD a second and third time."
1,So realistic you forget you're reading fiction,"Daniel Defoe put a lot of research into his 'Journal of the Plague Year,' yet it doesn't read like a history report. Rather, this is a novel so realistic you can quite literally feel what it must have been like to have lived in London at the time of the plague. The facts as he knew them, both from reading and interviews with those who lived through it, are revealed to us throughout the narrative. You get every detail of the plague, from the symptoms to the hysteria to the steps the government took to help insure the safety of the people. 'Journal of the Plague Year' is a fascinating and imminently readable book."
0,Hal Hartley-no thanks,"I dont feel like wasting my time writing a review here, but I want to warn you to skip films from someone who can make even the bubbliest of people, Parker Posey, dull. Skip it, this and Henry Fool, but not Amateur"
1,Just more CHOBITS!,"If you're into anything CLAMP, or Sci-Fi, then I strongly recommend this book! But, read the first 2 book before this one, okay?If you watched ""Carrie"" (The movie) when you were little, then you could totally buy this! Even if your 10 (I'm almost 11, BTW)"
0,Quirky for OS 9.3 and OS 10.1,"I am not happy with the performance of this drive with my Apple Power mac G-3. It is slow and error prone. I bought another that is much better. Pass on this item if you are an Apple owner, it's an annoyance for a Mac. Works fine with windows but I don't really need it for that :("
1,Super mask,"This mask is very comfortable, breathes easily, soft seal. I also purchased replacement filter cartridges and they appear to be of very good quality as well."
0,Obsolete!,"I'm sorry, my friends, but this is NOT Bach! Funereal tempos, thick textures, a million players to a part - this set should be of interest to no one except historians of outdated performance practice. Get the Gardiner version for music."
0,It does not have all the levels,"This game does not have all of the original Donkey Kong arcade game levels. I don't think it is too much to ask to expect all of the levels from the 80's vintage 8-bit arcade game.As it stands, you just start repeating the same levels over and over again . . . and that gets boring quick. Had I known it was an incomplete adaptation, I would not have bought it."
1,*JACK SKELLINGTON,I loved it a lot because it had a very good material on it and no holes or had rips on it.And it came earlier than expected.
0,An okay gift...,"I just received this hat in the mail. It's made of sturdy material and was stitched well, but the lines on the hat aren't where they should be. Kind of defeats its purpose..."
1,Clears up the sometimes obscure nuances of pointers in C,"Great book. It taught me more about pointers in the C language than any other C book I've used. However, it's not just about pointers. It's a good book for learning C in general."
1,Wonderfully accurate sound! Awesome response!,"I Purchased these as rear speakers to complete surround sound set.I had no idea that they would sound sooo nice!They have a wonderful range of response and the resolution is great! After plugging them in, I ended up routing all power just to them and listening to a full symphony from my rear speakers!Solid as tanks and outstanding performers!"
0,This is why people steal content,"While I don't condone people stealing their content, decisions by backward thinking organizations like MLB all but assure that people are going to. Putting out non-HD content in this day and age is like putting out black and white videos in 1980. Whoever wants to buy this content wants it in BluRay HD, not DVD. So these people are going to steal it off the internet to get it in the format that they want because MLB won't provide it. I truly believe most of these people would pay for it if MLB offered it. But since they don't, MLB loses money. Again, I don't condone stealing your content, but I also don't condone paying for this content since it is in a near-defunct format. Save your money until MLB gets their act together and puts it out in a modern format."
1,GOOD CONDITION,ITEM ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION AS PROMISED BUT A LITTLE BIT LATE AND EMAILS TO SELLER WHERE NOT RETURNED. OTHERWISE GOOD TRANSACTION.
1,"Sweet, sweet book.","I ordered this book before my daughter attended preschool but it only arrived a couple of weeks after she started since we have been relocated to China. I am sure there were other books I was reading and the Berenstain bears going to school dvd definitely helped but amongst it all, I highly believe that this book eased my daughter's fears the most about school. She related really well to the character (I named the character in the book after her) and this is definitely one of the books we have to read before bedtime on school nights. It is simple, sweet and straight to the point and I so wish this author has more books in this series about school. :) Excellent!"
1,Perfect addition to my collection,"Bought two of these jars to add to my candy bar collection of apothecary jars and containers. I did notice a small chip around the rim of one but with the lid on it's almost unnoticeable and on the outside so no one will get cut or scratched.Great size, good sturdy quality. good purchase."
0,Lacks depth,"While it has a few interesting advises, most of them are common sense, even for us who are first time parents. For instance, everyone knows that you have to remove the plastic in which a new mattress is packed.It also lacks depth in the topics it covers. For example, it only spends a few seconds on breastfeeding, while we were expecting to learn breastfeeding positions, how to know when your baby has had enough milk, and how to burp the baby.It wasn't worth the money for us."
1,Dyspraxia Developmental Co-ordination Disorder,This is an outstanding book. It is extremely helpful and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a child that has been diagnosed with developmental dyspraxia. I only wish I had discovered it 10 years ago. Now we are playing catch-up but it provides very helpful information for our family and is teaching us how to make our child's life easier.
1,DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK-BE AFRAID OF WHAT'S IN THE DARK!,"PITCH BLACK is an incredible movie. Lots of suspense. Richard B. Riddick is very intriguing to figure out. Very intense characters. The added footage on the unrated version really explains and adds a lot to some of the scenes of the movie that you see in the rated version. As David Twohy says, ""Sometimes the less you see is scarier."" Not knowing what's out there makes it a lot more bone chilling. I highly recommend seeing this movie to everyone. Especially fans of Vin Diesel(like me)! Would I be afraid of the dark?----not if I was with Riddick(in which case, he might need to be afraid of the dark!!!) Keep up the great work, Vin! Can't wait for the sequel!!!!"
0,sucky,"This product really sucks. First of all, it does not do what it claims to do. Second of all, it broke after several uses. I learned my lesson. One should never stray from trusted brands when it comes to these made-in-China stuff."
1,I've about worn mine out!,I enjoy listening to George Winston. Adam Zampino has similar qualities. No regrets buying this CD!!
1,SD32,I am using this to supplement the 16GB SSD on HP Mini 1000 including installing most apps on SD. This 32GB SD seems to be working well and I would use this vendor and this PNY SD Card again for similar applications.
0,Not as advertised ...,"This roll is only 40ft, not 50ft as advertised. Other than that, the product is as described."
0,"If you loved this at the theater, HOLD OFF on buying the DVD!","It's now well documented-that Magnolia/Magnet did NOT use the original theatrical subtitles, but simplified, inferior ones of their own devising:http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/03/let_the_wrong_subtitles_in_to.htmlMagnolia/Magnet has promised to re-release with the original subtitles, but until Amazon changes ""English"" to ""English (theatrical)"" in the subtitles available, better steer clear of this as a vampire would a roomful of cats.By the way, if you're one of those who pre-ordered to get this DVD as soon as possible, you'll either need to pony up for the re-release or learn Swedish -- Magnolia/Magnet has refused to exchange the first release for the new one."
1,A Wonderful Read!,"This is one to have on your bookshelf to refresh yourself with the sciences once in a while. Although I have seen much of the information before from various sources, I have not found a book that presents such a wide breadth of science so succinctly and entertainingly. Read and enjoy! (If you like this, a wonderful companion book is ""The Discoverers"" by Daniel Boorstin.)"
1,Hpuses By Mail,"Excellent background material on my research of ""Sears' Houses!"" This educator and historian simply did not realize how many households in the 20th century had Sears to thank for ""complete"" homes!!!"
0,"Not good for thick, longer hair because of clips","If you have medium long to long hair that is thick, this set of hot rollers might drive you insane. The concept is great, but the clips are completely inadequate. They burn your fingers as you try to secure them and just do not seem big or round enough to cover the entire roller around your hair. Several just slipped right out as I tried to secure them, even with small amounts of hair and they hung down instead of more secured to the scalp like they should for optimum curls. I would hesitate to buy them. As far as when you do get one to hold right, the curl comes out nice and if you give yourself some spray, it will turn out ok. Otherwise, I recommend something different."
1,"Very simple need, this works fine on Apple OSX and Vista",It does what I needed. It lets me read 4GIG SDHC cards. It was fairly inexpensive and it just works.
1,This DVD is great!!!,My 3 year old LOVES this DVD. It's great becuase he gets to see the actual construction vehicles in action! We've watched it about 15 times in 3 days!
1,Best cream ever!,This is the best cream for dry hands and feet. It works wonders on dry cracked heels! I love this stuff and I couldn't live without it.
0,What a snore!,"This is an extremely tedious novel. it is about a girl who helps out a midwife but then goes and runs away to an inn. It is an elementary book. This is not interesting because all the girl wants to do is make a name for herself. You cannot relate to her at all because she doesn't do anything except chores and, well, midwifing. She doesn't think about anything else throughout the whole book and when you're done you can't believe you wasted your time on such a boring book! Sorry, Amazon, but this book is not worth your money. If you're just DYING to read it get it at a library."
0,Isnt worth a penny,Wow this is crap. Cant believe I wasted my money on this. His lyrics are really bad. His rap is bad. The beats are bad. This whole cd is bad. I suggest you dont buy this cd. It isnt worth it. Im glad this album didnt win any Grammys.
0,Does not work with Win 7 64-bit,"If you have a computer that is more than 2 years old do not purchase this. It does not wok with that machine. I know it has been stated before, but this software is made ONLY for older machines. Do not listen to the product description when it states that is work with Win 7."
1,"Simply, Awesome!","This movie is AWESOME! This is a period piece film, about Japan invading China. Also, about the man who inspired and trained Bruce Lee. Donnie Y is a great fighter/actor. Very cool and he kicks azz big time. Every night I do the Ip Man moves on my man. All that's missing is him sliding down the pole after I punch him in rapid succession! Just kidding. My whole family LOVED this pic. Part II is good also, but not as good as Part I. Do youself a favor, see this pic."
1,"Not his best, but still Groucho",The humor is toned-down. It was 1942 after all and Simon and Shuster weren't about to publish Groucho's dirty jokes. But it was a fun read and only took a couple hours to get through. There are funny pictures throughout and it's interesting to read how the tone of the book CLEARLY changed between first and final draft. I think that Pearl Harbor made it a wee-bit difficult to really let it rip in the Government's directions.
1,Great Workout in Less Than an Hour,"This is a great workout for women on the go or with packed schedules. Although there isn't a solid block of cardio time as is common with Tai-Bo style workouts, the cardio-strength intervals on this DVD had my heart rate going and muscles burning within the first 15 minutes. I felt stronger even after my first workout and I now look forward to mastering the harder moves (maintaining a single handed plank position while pumping a 5 Ib weight). The instructor is okay, not one of my faves, but not as bad as some of the other reviewers may claim. Lower the volume, put on your favorite tunes, count your reps (about 6 per set) and it's no big deal. And ladies, don't hate on a women who's put time and effort into her ""jacked"" look. Every woman has her own health and image ideal."
1,Read the Book in One Day,"Just briefly want to say, I have NEVER read a complete book in one day. Usually because there are always places that you can stop and do errands, chores, etc. However, this book does NOT allow for any such nonsense. Between the suspense and the moments of humor, Ms. Scottoline certainly has a winner in this book."
1,We all know life is not fair,"This book is one of the sadest ones out there. It is about humanity, and selflesness. Usually selflesness is a good thing, but where do we draw the line? Is there a time when it is OK to be selfish, and give up selflessness? The book strongly and unbiasly relays the burden selfless decisions incurr on it's loyals. The little girl with the ability to save her sister, is suffering from her constant giving; and to live a normal life, she must quit giving, and may result in her sister's death.Then fate brings a twist to the story, and the book ends unexpectedly, leaving the above questions left un-answered. The ending higlights how unfair and sneaky life is. It's a good book to read if you are feeling sorry for yourself, and you think your life is miserable, and are looking for a story worse than yours, so you can feel better... Therapy for those who need help to appreciate their blessings."
1,Practical and Useful Expressions,This book has been very useful for me as an ESL student. It contains lots of idioms and everyday expressions. Highly Recommended!
0,A complete waste of money.,We have purchased two of these pumps and we lucky if they worked for a month or two being used at the most 2 to 3 hours a day. Last summer we stored our brand new pump carefully knowing how sensitive these pumps are. We set up our pool this spring and plugged in our carefully-stored pump- nothing. There is no reason why this should not work other than shoddy workmanship. Don't waste your money.
1,Very comfortable,"Although the suit isn't very attractive or flattering, I wanted a cheap, simple suit with shoulder straps rather than a halter strap (very uncomfortable). The suit is pretty much just very basic but very comfy. So if you're after style this isn't for you. Practicality & comfort are it's top points."
0,PumpkinHead 4 should have stopped at 1,"Silly plot. Horrible tie to first movie. Goes on and on with same premise of kill the one who calls the monster, but takes for ever to do it. Do not waste your money."
1,Greatness,"This book was a great read. It inspired me to just keep reading and reading. It is one of those books that are called a ""have to turn the page"", and ""cant put 'em down"" I would recomend this book to anyone and had my best friend read it just because. If you like great reads about reality and ""what happens to bad kids"" kind of gutsy stuff then you will like this book."
1,Mass murder stumps Peter,"This book begins with a mass murder in a trendy restaurant. The police think they have found the man who did it and they are ready to close the case. Peter Decker thinks otherwise and he spends the rest of the book trying to find out what was really behind the murders. He looks into the family lives of some of the deceased and finds multiple motives for the murders. Several family members stand to gain financially and personally from the deaths of their relatives. Peter is accused of sexual harrassment when he interviews one of the suspects, and Rina stands by him when he is forced to defend himself. This is another good entry in the series."
1,Great Shimano Sora Cassette Gears,"I ordered this 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21T 8 speed Shimano Sora, and it is great so far for my biking level of my road bike. I use the gears 12-14T at the most with a cadence of about 90-100 RPM and I can go for about 36-40 MPH speed on the flat and downhill. For the uphill with a grade of about 5 to 8 degrees, I use 15-19T gears. I rarely use 21T gear, only when there is a big uphill like around 10 degrees. I am very happy with this compact gears. I have a triple Sora Shimano crankset of 30-42-52T in the front of my road racing bike. Most of the time I use 42-52T front gears with 80-100 RPM cadence. I rarely use 30T front gear only for big uphill. This compact cassette gears are smooth in changing gears. It is compatible for both 8 speed of any bike such as road bikes and mountain bikes. I use this for my 24 speed road bike, 3 front gears of 30-42-52T x multiply by back 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21T = 24 speeds."
0,Good for a Beginner,I ordered this tripod and when it came I was so disappointed that I sent it back immediately. The neoprene made my hands itch. It wasn't level when I put my camera on it. It angered me so much that I bought a carbon fiber tripod and magnesium head from the good people at Slik in the same hour. Although it was of poor quality for my use I would still say it would be good for someone who is just starting out in photography. I give it a low rating partly because I was being cheap and I should have went for the carbon fiber in the first place.
0,Not Worth the Time Suck,"As a fan of all of the Sookie books and someone who liked last season, I'm not feelin this season and quite frankly am bored with its reliance on shock value. It's disjointed, totally lacking the comic relief so well done in the books, and way off the book plot. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being great, I'd give it a 2. It's truly not worth the time suck."
1,Great stories,I loved reading this book first in the English then looking over to sort out the French words. I am just entering college French 201 and I feel like I can separate the more common words but it was very nice to have the English right there on the next page. I didn't have to turn to the back of the book which is nice.
1,If ou have boys they will love it,"Entertaining. I am not saying I watched the whole thing but it was pretty decent. My boys loved it. My biggest complaint is that they only have one video thus far in the series. Another complaint I have is that you can't play chapters, you have to either play the whole movie or stop it manually @ some point. Since I am mean and my kids are allowed only 30 minutes - 1 hour (TOPS) of tv/day, it is kind of a pain. Otherwise, great video.Ps. Our video came w/ an Atlantix movie special feature. It was pretty dumb - the kids kind of liked the shark and octopus parts but really it was a poorly disguised commercial for that product line"
0,Horrific crimes and abrupt ending!,"I've loved Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels for a few years. I was excited to pick up Blow Fly but had a tough time with all the abundance of horrific details of the crimes. The twists and turns the story was taking had me spellbound yet at times confused. But as I neared the last 5 pages of the book, I wondered how the book was going to end and tie up all the ends...and boy, was I on target and VERY unhappy with the ending! Benton knew the Dard family and associates and they didn't know who he was? And he happened to kill one twin in the wine cellar while the other twin gets away so easily? Give me a break...it all ended too quickly, too conveniently when there was so much wonderful promise...what a huge disappointment. And now after reading reviews of her next 2 books, Trace & Predator, I'm not sure I can stand more disappointment and gore through Scarpetta's eyes. I think I'll be looking for a new author who is more consistent...sorry Patricia!"
0,Bait and switch...I am STEAMED!,"Would give this a ZERO if I could! We thought we were getting Erik's story and found out we got SUCKERED into buying something other than tha. What a bummer for all the loyal fans of the Enchanted, Forbidden and Untamed books to find that THIS was the long awaited sequel that told Erik's story. It was HORRIBLE! We ALL feel CHEATED! Actually - I feel better just pretending that Erik's story hasn't been told yet than to think it was this piece of drivel! I'm sorry to say but since EL left those books, the Only series and Autumn Lover/Winter Fire behind - she hasn't written a decent thing that has to do with romance! If you want to write suspense or fiction or whatever RIDICULOUSLY descriptive book you want on jade, pearls, rubies, jems, ancient manuscripts, gold etc., etc. then STOP calling them ROMANCE novels! Move into the suspense genre of fiction and stop using the true romance fans out here to buy your books that don't have a THING to do with romance!"
0,Not what I paid for,"I was not necessarily comfortable paying this much for an 8'' toy, but I have a Bleach fan in the house, so I thought it would we a welcome addition, even with the price. It arrived in fairly good time, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. However, the toy I paid for was the toy in the picture, and what I got was a somewhat cheap toy with loose seams and no character whatsoever. The toy is cheaply made, and I feel like the arms will come off any second. It's an expressionless toy, with no posing ability. It's essentially made of felt, which is not what was promised. I feel like I was cheated."
0,WAKE UP ALREADY.,"Evanescence sucks. Their just as bad as this other angst ridden garbage like Nirvana and Linkin Park. Amy Lee can't sing, and she's overrated. Her, Kurt Cobain, Chester Bennington, and Mike Shinoda are the worst rock vocalists ever. In fact, almost every rock band of today is just the same boring flat out garbage. A note to all these sucky bands:Quit whining about how miserable your lives are already, none of us wanna hear about it. It's a good thing we have bands like The Darkness and Jet, because hopefully that is a sign that will be saved from this angst-filled crap soon."
1,"great music, singer lacking","From the opening riff of this disk I started to get very excited, this guitar player is something special. The songs are well writen and powerful. It reminded me of dream theater in a couple of spots. The only thing that holds this back from becoming a true classic is the singer. To be fair, he fits some of the songs and even sounds strong on ""Chosen Ones"". But, there are several spots where he straines to hit notes he is not capable of, sounds out of tune in other places, and ends one song sounding like a tone deaf first day loser on american idol. You will know which one I am refering to when you here it. All of this is relevant because I just heard that this Guitar player, Magnus Karlsson, is teaming up with Tony Harnell in the new band Starbreaker! Due out March 21st. With this guy's chops and Tonys pipes LOOK OUT! Since tastes in singers vary, this disk is a must buy for power metal fans, the music is that good."
0,Disappointed,"I was not expecting this set to be of non-original recordings and was disappointed that it wasn't mentioned in any part of the ad. Some of the tracks are pretty good, but I was expecting originals."
1,Great for the price,"I am no music expert but so far I am really enjoying this system. It's pretty cool looking - but don't put it in your bedroom cause at night it really is quite bright - the blue light never goes off. My only complaint is that I use it with my laptop and plug/unplug quite a bit and I have to turn the sound down every time cause it makes a really loud pop if I don't. The sound is really good altho it's not going to rock a 2 story house or anything. My place is tiny but I wouldn't recommend it for a big space. Bass - if that's your thing probably not the best. But for ME - it's great. I'm not a techno nerd and the sound is clear, clean, melodic and no static..."
0,Sophomore Slump,"Yikes! This is pretty bad. I'm a big fan of the first album, but something is really lacking on this one. The lyrical wit is still there, and some of the piano work is nice...but the vocals are grating, and most of the songs are either irritating or uninteresting.I expected a great second album, or at least a decent one, but this just isn't it. I've come back to it a few times, hoping it would grow on me, but no luck. I'm pretty surprised...hopefully they'll improve with their next release, but I definitely wouldn't buy another Dresden Dolls album without hearing it first."
1,Legend of the Red Wolf,"Legend of the Red Wolf successfully combines elements of nature and Native American wisdom in a realistic story of conflict resolution. The author's teaching experience is evident in this story about family situations, art, animals and the environment, bullies, and problem solving. Tony, the main character, is a real kid with real problems who considers various ways of handling those problems and creates a workable solution. A fine addition to the growing field of Latino-authored books for children and young adults."
1,performance matches original,"I was appalled at the cost of an ""official"" Nikon replacement battery and decided to give these a try (especially since they got better reviews than the ""official"" type). I have had them now for over a month and they hold a charge as long as the original battery did when it was new. Excellent value, excellent product."
1,DVD release,"I love this movie, had it on video years ago. However, I just ordered the DVD and put it in today. There is some confusion caused by the fact that the DVD did not play the English subtitles for the Japanese dialogue in the first part of the movie.I've seen other reviews here on this site that address the subtitle problem, and indeed, the subtitles are on the disc but must be found indirectly with the player settings for alternate subtitles. No worries now!There's something undescribable about this movie that makes it so interesting and appealing, and I recommend it as a great watch. It looks great and I really enjoy seeing it again in better quality."
0,Boring.,"Ruby really disappoints me. The game is boring and has NO replay value.Don't get me wrong; Leaf Green was SO much better than this.You'd probably have more fun playing the other games, just skip this, you won't be missing out on much."
0,Short and quick analsis. So so in my opinon,"I felt that this book did help in some way. The review of each chapter was very short and concise. It did not offer lengthy in depth analysis of each chapter. The information was general and filled with cute bits of information. The book has a funny way of its paper. Its frilled at the ends. I do not know why they did this. I was hoping for more information and more substantional information to read. Overall, I felt that this was a good book with limited information. I thought that the analysis on book 1-4 was much better and filled with more data. The price is not worth the book. I did like the cut out tab of the last page. The book is worth reading but only for short information to read."
1,CRAZY FLY,THIS BOOK WAS STUPID FLY!!! IT WAS SO CRAZY HOW THAT GIRL WAS PULLING ALL THE THINGS SHE WAS DOING OFF. BITCH RELOADED IS A FLY BOOK TOO MAKE SURE YOU READ IT BECAUSE THE END OF BITCH WILL LEAVE YOU HANGING!!!(BUT IN A GOOD WAY OF COURSE)
0,phantom order,"I am unable to review Un Ballo in Mascera-verdi because I did not receive the cd that I ordered. I was issued a refund, but I preferred that the seller reship the correctly ordered product. I have this particular performance on vinyl -boxed set- and the performance is excellent especially the conducting."
0,"Shoots high, hits low","Punish the sinners delivers an interesting but ultimately unsatisfactory suspense story centering around a Catholic school in a small town. While the story initially raises some interesting questions about theology and Catholic doctrine, Saul eventually forsakes those topics completely in the pursuit of a ridiculously far-fetched tale of obsession and mind-control. There is literally no character development whatsoever, and Saul goes a step worse in drawing on multiple character stereotypes: the sinister priest, the disbeleiving psychologist, the popular jock, the picked-on ""ugly girl,"" and more. If Saul had done anything memorable with such characters, it might be worthwhile, but this is simply unacceptable. To top off the frustration, the ending is simply atrocious, and does nothing to conclude the story; it feels like a bad horror movie where the killer is still alive at the end (though that is somewhat of a recurring theme in Saul's work). Not recommended at all."
1,Perfect indoor flowers,"I bought several plants from Hirt's. They were surprisingly small and weak, particularly when compared to Logee's, the greenhouse that I usually ordered from, although their prices were lower. The Jasmines actually were the healthiest of the lot and flowered within a month, before some of the other plants even grew a new leaf. Judging from the other reviews, I might have been lucky.Jasmines grow easily indoors and are resistant to pests and fungi. The flowers are simply heavenly. They are perfect plants for windowsills."
1,Just Love it.,I just love it to watch the Dennis The Menace. Most of them I like when he was younger and old Mr. Wilson was in it. Later on was Just OK.But he play good and then when he was older they did not make him play stupid just like they did with Leave It to Beaver that at age 12 he still was stupid and it did not fit the role.
0,Hate them.,"These earphones are horribly designed, the clips that hold them on your ears are so small and tightly curved that I could not wear them. They might fit a very small child but not an average size adult."
1,A window into my heart.,"I loved this book when I was a girl. Now, reading it to my four children, I get quite emotional when I realize how much I was impacted by this story. It really did partially make me into the mother and home-educator I am today. It amazes me how deeply the wisdom of this book sunk into me. Everyone who homeschools their children should read this - for themselves and for their children."
1,true color of dalvid coverdale--which is now dead and gone,"Let me be brief and simple on this ablum. If you think your musical taste is closer to Blackmore than to Coverdale this album is a disaster. Otherwise, this is a evidence of what makes David Coverdale such a great singer. Jazzy, bluesy and a little bit funky sound clearly shows why he and Blackmore couldn't go along together. I'm not saying Coverdale is better and Blackmore is bad or vice versa. What I'm trying to make it clear is that they were so different. ""Blind Man"" is my favorite track here. Sadly, Coverdale later remade this track in a shorter, mediocre version in ""Ready & Willing"" album. I believe that proves that he lost his true color after all."
1,Outstanding,"So maybe Bill Dear does have a bit of an ego, but you've got to admit, he IS good. This book is a fascinating account of a tragic set of circumstances. A very good read, one you won't be able to put down (unless you're a hopeless cynic!) I just wish the story had a happier ending..."
1,Handy little runabout bag,"I rarely travel without my little black bag voluntarily. On long walks, the straps are more comfortable than a purse. On impromptu grocery runs or quick errands it saves me from getting a pile of plastic bags. When traveling, it always seems to be halfway full with the little vital things. Usually it's a snack and drink, a magazine, a couple of gifts and a camera. When you're done with it, just stuff it back into the little bag, which takes about 30 seconds.The fabric is lightweight, and the straps are not padded or bulky, which is a positive now that I am out of school, but would not work for a full time student every day. While it makes a great carryon bag, I have not needed to check it yet, and might hesitate to do so. The fabric gets a little crinkly, but in black, it still looks fairly good; I wouldn't hesitate to throw my comfy sneakers in it during a wedding."
0,Expensive,I got this one in the Chinese grocery shop in WestMinister ave for 5$ for the 4pack. Even Ace Hardware sells for 4$a piece which makes 16$/4pack.Amazon is far too expensive.
0,"The name ""Crisp & Clear"" is a joke!","We bought this monitor because we read it was good last year in several places. Based on our experience, it was not a good product at all. There was so much interference which we (at first) blamed on different legitimate things (airplanes, phones, appliances plugged in nearby). The reception was so bad when you were talking at a loud voice in the nursery, you could only hear mumbling and not understand a word being said. We finally decided there was no legitimate excuse for all the probolems when my husband had it on and was sitting in the porch swing. The interference flared up as he was swinging back and forth! That was riduculous so we returned it and got the Fisher Price Vibrating Monitor instead - same price, and boy is it so much better. Absolutely no interference or static and you can hear and understand every single word whispered in the nursery. With all the problems it would be smart to not bother buying this monitor at all."
0,Political Tract Masquerade,"This is a conflicted review. The author allows much of himself to show through this book, so although I enjoyed some parts of the book, I found myself disliking Barash as a person, and especially as a scientist. He loves data that supports his political stance, and ignores anything that threatens that position. Because of this, he overlooks some obvious material that would give a much clearer understanding of the topic.True to the book's theme, almost of his villians (enemies) are selected from the opposite end of the political spectrum.For someone who is naive about conflict studies, the book might serve as a general, if rather biased introduction., For anyone who has invested any time in pondering these matters, the book is a waste of time and energy."
0,Many issues,"When removing backing little patches of papper would remain and could not be removed making that section useless. Roll with given stock number was 24 x 50 inches. My husband suggested I should have tryed blow drying it before peeling it for esaier peeling. It was a good suggestion but I did not try it as I had already returned the product. I was able to get a small enough section to test on a photo and it seemed to work well enough, however it is not useful on the larger scale I had bought it for. Buyer beware."
0,"Exciting, but...er...mature matter","This book is not the genteel book that L'Engle readers are used to...it contains some mature matter. Nothing bizzare or vulgar, but not for young children, more for teens. It is very exciting. That's all I will say, except that the adult's form didn't work. I'm 15."
1,Fiber optic cable,"Another great deal from Amazon. Delivery was good, product works great & the price was better. After shopping around for the best price in BestBuy, Walmart & online, this was the best deal."
1,GREAT SHOT OF STRENGTH AND STRETCH!!,"For any beginner, this is a great video to start to feel the stretch and isolation of the yoga movements. For intermediates, this may be a tad easy although still a good return to some basic positions and stretches - particularly for the upper body. The instructor (Jennifer) is quite good and the poses are shown from different angles which makes it ideal for confirmation that you are doing the stretch correctly. Also, the two 20-minute break-downs make it an ideal way to start your day with the choice of either an upper- or lower-body focus. All-in-all it is a great addition to a collection that I am sure you'll return to over and over in your yoga routine."
1,Not like the good ole days,"My grandmother had had one of these mixers forever and swears by them to make her divinity and meringues. She uses her Kitchen Aid for most things but without the Sunbeam she has been unable to make many of her goodies we have grown to love. We finally found this one on Amazon and she was so excited to get it for Christmas. This one however is made almost entirely of plastic and is cheaply made unlike the Kitchen Aid. The reason we like this one so much is of the high quality glass bowls included and the assortment of beaters that are included. I just wish Sunbeam would make a version of this mixer made of metal like the Kitchen Aid. This one costs 1/3 the price of a Kitchen Aid, so it is a good value provided it lasts as long."
1,Best thing I've gotten in a while,"I need to add more fiber and potassium to my diet. I used to make smoothies and have a Vitamix which is the bomb. But it's a pig to lug out when i just want one smoothie for myself. I think that's why I stopped making smoothies. So I started looking into personal/mini blenders and saw this. The amount of positive reviews is impressive and here's another one. This does exactly what I want. It allows me to quickly and easily puree some fruits and spinach with a little milk and some protein powder. It handles everything perfectly, but does trip over the spinach SLIGHTLY. There are usually a few bits of spinach lives left in the holes in the housing around the blades. But just a tiny amount. Other than that, which is nothing, it's exactly what I needed and wanted. This is a nifty addition to my kitchen and will get used for lots of things."
1,Fast Read,"I do enjoy these books, but they are all starting to sound the same. Always the torchered soul finding love after hundeds or thousands of years.I do like the characters. I read Acheron first before realizing it was #12 so commited myself to the series,but am groing tired of the same plot."
1,If only we had known this information at puberty!!!!,Toni Weschler has given women (and men) a great tool for understanding the mysteries of the female body. She is so thorough that I know if I have a question relating to my cycle and/or body that I just need to pull out her book. If only we were taught this information upon reaching puberty!!! I am waiting for another book from Toni Weschler.
0,Kick to the Groin,"Send this movie to the Smithsonian. It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen -- and I've seen ""A Gnome Named Gnorm"" starring Anthony Michael Hall, ""Ishtar"" starring Beatty and Hoffman, and ""Young Einstein"" starring Yahoo Serious. I would rather someone jam something sharp into my eye than watch this debacle again."
0,I was stupid enough to buy two of these cameras.,"I purchased two of the RCA digital cameras 11/02, one as a gift for my son. They took very nice photos. Exactly one year after purchase, my battery compartment cover cracked and the camera became useless. The same thing happened to my son's camera at almost the same time. As the covers were attached only by two small screws, I assumed (my first mistake)I would be able to order replacement parts and have two working cameras. I got nothing but the run-around from RCA customer ""service,"" and the generous ""offer"" of allowing me to buy two replacement cameras for a couple hundred dollars. They refused to allow me just to buy the parts. I will never buy another RCA product and will make sure as many poeple know it as possible."
1,Awesome and simple!,"After reading the other reviews, I realized that this invested would be a great one, and it is TRUE!Easy to hook up (red, white, yellow cables - your own) from VCR out to Canopus device.Firewire to firewire.As a Mac use, I used iMovie to import movie - you won't hear the audio on import, but will on playback and editing.SUPER!"
0,Hamed is the biggest joke ever!,"I classify the greatest day in my life the night Barrera knocked Hamed from corner to corner and gave him his first official lose. Hamed never fought anyone, Kevin Kelly doesn't count because Kelly was old, in his prime Kelly would have destroyed Hamed. All that aside, I checked out the book from my local library and read through it the other day and I must say it is terrible. I find it totally one sided, Evans is in love with Hamed. He wants to be Hameds husband aparently, because I havent seen [behind] kissing like that for ever! He makes Hamed sound like a GOD when he is merly a pitiful boxer and 2nd rate man from what I read in Boxing Monthly. Can you say 11 kids out of wedlock; him and Oscar are battling for Dead Beat Dad awards! I hope a book is released from a person who isnt looking to kiss [behind], and tell the truth about a guy who is cocky, arogant to fans and fellow boxers not to mention a bad human being!"

1,An inspiring piece of work,"Although I could discuss their definition of Knowledge Management (KM) and therefore the distinction they make between KM and benchlearning, I found this book very, very inspiring! It provides the background to support the theories and offers a process organisations can use to incorporate learning through examples on their culture."
1,iPod/iPhone USB retractable cable,"Simply genius product!! Great product and keeps all the extra cord stored neatly. If you don't have one, buy 4!! And a price that can't be beat."
0,Very little content,"Although the demonstrations of techniques are good, be aware that 25 minutes out of only 40 is an interview with Avi Nardia and Albert Timen. The ""third party protection"" advertised on the cover takes up all 4 minutes on the DVD."
1,Raquel Rocks!!!,"You can not go wrong with Raquel Welch in leather pants, a poncho on with nothing on underneath and packing some heat!! The gang led by Borgnine is one of the best groups of idiots on the screen! My only confusion was the gunslinger in black? He appeared and disappeared without much explanation??Fun western film."

1,Don't commit a crime in Texas,"""Texas Crime Chronicles"" is a must-read true crime book about the more newsworthy crimes which took place in Texas over recent years. There are 17 fascinating stories written by various writers and reporters. My favorites include the Diane Zamora/David Graham cadet murderers; the cheerleader mom Wanda Holloway; and Charles Whitman, the sniper in the tower. You will enjoy each story if you are a true crime fan; if you're not a true crime fan, you might become one after reading this book."
1,A Powerful Book,This is a powerful book and much of its power lies in the self revelations of the authors. They are not only excellent writers but they reveal some of their hard times and failures in a way most of us would not. You cannot help but be impressed with their decision to praise and stay faithful even in the most difficult circumstances.
1,"Modest cost, amazing results","I am new to knife sharpening and had previously found obtaining a fine edge a real mystery. The simple Lansky Deluxe devise guides the precise angle for excellent results. It does take just a little getting used to. I found it a little awkward at first and occasionally tipped the fairly narrow stones, but there is no big learning curve; with just a little practice you can turn out shaving sharp blades. If you are a knife sharpening newbie you can buy this product with confidence because it works, works well and quickly becomes easy to use. The Lansky is simple and effective and Amazon is always good to deal with."
1,Measure of this Man!,The CD was even better then I could have wished for! My only complaint is that I wish there have been more songs to listen too! Just listening to the CD makes my heart sing and my soul melt. It has all the flavor that a person could stand! Can't wait until the next CD is released! Clay just keeps getting better with every song he sings!
0,SP-D1700 no better than SP-D1600,"So. I get this new fresh from the factory SP-D1700 and it works fine, with very light use, for about 7 or 8 months. Understand, when I say ""light use"", I mean maybe one DVD a month. Then, just like the SP-D1600 it just one day stops working. I continues to load disk and once and a while it will play one for about 20 seconds, then it quits. I've written a letter to Mark Simons, Vice President for digital products division. That was three weeks ago;so far I've been roundly ignored.October 7, 2007So here is my follow up after sending my second letter to Mr Simons on August 29,2007. Still no response. I have since however, read may complaints on various about being given the run around to just being ignored by toshiba(small""t"" from now on). These are signs of a company that is in trouble. I will chalk this up to experience and stay clear of anything made by toshiba in the future. THANK YOU MR. SIMONS."
0,What happened to quality?,"I've worn Fancy Pants for many years, but these are the first I've bought in a while. They are, for the size, very skimpy. The material is noticeably thinner than in older pairs. Worst of all, there is not only no lining at all in the crotch area, the seams in that area are very thick and cut into a part of you you don't want to think about when you're going for a killer shot. Time to find another brand."
1,Always a great movie,Wow I can never get sick of this movie. No matter how many times I've seen it it is always so cool. The picture is great and the extras are even better
1,California Wine Appreciation 101,Rickman is classic in this tale of how Napa Chardonnay won a French competition in 1974. Beautifully shot--the helicopter work over the vineyards is breathtaking--this movie sits alongside Sideways and A Very Good Year in my wine appreciation library.And isn't that Mike Grgich eating a roast chicken?
1,Laura and Gail are back at it again.,"Typical Laura Crum novel but that is a good thing. Laura does not produce literary masterpieces but they are intertaining and full of horse information and knowledge. Her books are a find and great reading for horse enthusiasts. You roll those clues around in your head as she does trying to tie them together to solve the murder. I will continue to read and enjoy Ms. Crums ""horsey mysteries""."
0,"This version might be a hit in China, BUT...!","I have always loved this movie, a story based on a Mark Twain writing. I saw it last on TV years ago and wanted to get a copy for myself and for the college film class I teach. The DVD sucks! The color is off just enough to to be irritating and the initial recording is in Chinese! While you can change the language, the dubbing is off....lips moving, no words or words and people just standing there. Unless you want to waste several dollars, I would not buy this knock off copy. I did find a very scarce VHS copy which restored my sanity. I should say the purchase of the ""Chinese version"" wasn't all bad, my students got a good laugh and a lesson in purchasing DVDs."
0,Won't Play on Most DVD Players.,"I have 5 DVD players and 3 MacIntosh computers. This DVD-A disc WILL NOT play on most of my DVD (not CD) players. It will play on my computers! I have dozens of DVD-A discs , and they play on ALL my DVD players. This disc won't.I would have rated this disc higher (probably), if I could have heard it."
0,A Star For Each Fully Realized Tune,"There are only two of them on this album --- Number of the Beast and Run to the Hills. I was going to impose an additional star penalty for the pain caused by missed opportunities, lack of rehearsal time, and just plain lazy sloppiness ---- but I'm generous. The difference between the filler and the good tunes is so distinct that a serious listener would swear it's two different bands. One that has learned to play a solid fully developed tune - together in tempo - and one that can't keep simple 4/4 rock timing. I was actually quite surprised at the disparity in quality on this album as well as the lost potental of several poorly executed tracks and others that are just plain filler. I recommend downloading single tracks when it comes to Iron Maiden --- some of their tracks are outright classics."
0,No,"Fab can definetely rhyme, but his songs on this album are the same thing with the exeption of Breath. More songs about women and i am tired of hearing about it. I give him credit for rhyming though so i gave him 1 star."
1,What depeche mode might have been with female vocals,"I discovered this band by accident but I love this album in particular. The dark and moody atmosphere of the music and sensual singing really come together on this album. I am a big fan of the Depeche Mode album SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION and although very different I think if you like that you will like this. Mode has a lot more up tempo songs and the mode stuff is harder but its the tech stuff and the feel that are similar.I also like a lot of bands with the same mood but a little harder, The Gathering, Lacuna Coil, Anti-m, Xymox, Evanescence, Within Temptation are all bands I like, Xymox being more electronic than the others. Of course music is subjective so what I like you might not.Chasing the Ghost is in my most played ipod playlists as well as in my car and my home stereo."
1,Great value,"Great value. The camera bag was just the right size for my Nikon D3100. It held the lens, the camera body and accessories."
0,Worst Headboard Ever,"Let me first start out by saying that I thought this was going to go lovely with the matching platform bed that I ordered. It had a nice finish, though it was a bit darker than I originally thought it was. Everything was going well until I had to assemble to bottom board. It was two inches too short! We measured just to be sure. It's one thing to be short on one board but two!? Yes, the top board that went across the top was also too short. We double checked the instructions to make sure we were matching all the correct parts and we were. I was unable to assemble the headboard correctly due to errors made by the manufacturer. I will not be able to get a refund because according the refund policy, the item must be unopened and unassembled! How do we know if we need to return the item if we don't assemble it? Though I am happy with the bed that I ordered, I am extremely upset about the headboard and the inability to recieve my money back."
0,Not quite what I expected.,"I chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo. They felt quite flimsy when I got them. I do like a lightweight earring, but not a flimsy one. The studs on these are not attached as firmly as I would like. One has already come off. They are however very pretty. The quality was just not what I expected."
1,As the Crow Flies,I enjoyed reading this book. A typical Jeffrey Archer novel with little twists that kept me reading until the satisfactory ending.
1,Review,This book says you all about Firewall & Internet Securities. This is written comparatively in easy language and is useful also to non technical persons.
0,Great Monitor .....until u own it for a few months....,I bought this monitor from an online retailer about 3 months ago. First month went well and I loved the richness of color and the controls and features it offered.Second month started to notice every once in a while the monitor would flicker in certain parts of screen.Third and final month I wake up and turn on the monitor to see a bright red patch of color in one corner. The lower corner had a bright green patch of color. I turned it off.... and waited 30 mins. Nope still there. Checked my video card with a different monitor and it was fine. Then I tried the p220 again and now it got worst. I had a bright blue screen plus a red patch in one corner and a green patch in another.I will never buy viewsonic again useless they show that they have corrected there flaws in this monitor and higher grade monitors. As they seem to have quality issues..
1,Legit BL-5C battery from CCMACCESSORIES,"I was having difficulty finding a legit Nokia BL-5C battery for my Nokia X2-01 cell phone. Much of what I found had pictures which did not match the description; for example, the picture indicated a certain mah rating, while the product description listed another. The battery I got from CCMACCESSORIES is legit (same mah rating as the battery included with the phone (1020 mah), has the Nokia hologram, and was in seemingly tamper-proof packaging) and is working just as well as the original.There are a number of sellers offering this battery - I can't speak for the others, since I did not purchase from them. I chose CCMACCESSORIES because they had the highest rating of those selling the battery as new."
0,Este libro es la guía de teléfonos,"Con todas estas estrellas dadas por lectores truchos caímos en la trampa y lo compramos. Amazon no debería suprimir sistemáticamente las críticas negativas, y ofrecer información más objetiva a sus clientes. Este libro es aburrido y pretencioso."
0,"Interesting, But Not Gripping","I must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee. The narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background. Because it's an autobiography, I don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it IS about him. I do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.It's an okay addition to one's list of books about Everest expeditions - which I must admit, I've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading ""Into Thin Air"". I wouldn't, however, use it as my primary source for information or impressions."
0,Very top heavy,"This tackle box has a lot of space, but the equipment it comes with sucks! It also is top heavy so when you extend out the trays it falls over and your tackle gets everywere! I threw it out and bought this which I am very happy with.Plano 3500 Size Tackle Box[...]"
1,Electric detector,A perfect tool when you need it to find out if there is power in the wiring. An essential tool for the DIY person.
0,DO NOT PURCHASE. WILL BREAK SOON AFTER USE,"I purchased this for my parents and after one use it no longer works. Everything powers on, though no audio can be heard. I've checked all connections, tried new batteries, tried charging and recharging. These are waste of money."
0,This camera stinks...,"This little hand-held portable camera was good at first, I thought that the picture and video quality was fine, but then, 2 weeks after I bought it, the screen broke, and I can't even use it as a webcam. So now, I have to manually try to delete pictures and it is very difficult to maneuver. Also, with a very small memory chip, you can take maybe 12 pictures before the memory is full. I would recommend spending that extra $20-$30 for a better camera as this is possibly one of the worst digital camcorders that I have ever seen."
0,i have listened to it a million times with my girlfriend- i cant f****** stand it,"My girlfriend bought this when it came out, and unwillingly i have listened to it nonstop since. My opinion is that this is nothing but a bunch of depressed emo whining about ex-girlfriends. If a girl gets you that depressed you are a dam fool who should just off yourself. The whole emo scene just pisses me off, all they do is whine and complain. I like my music with a positive message, or a socially aware, or a pissed off message like Madball, Vision Of Disorder, Hatebreed, Biohazard, stuff like that. Albums that people should check out instead of this would be Biohazard- Urban Discipline, Madball- Set It Off, Madball- Demonstrate My Style, Vision Of DIsorder- self titled"
1,This book sets the standards,"This book is chock full of wonderful investment advice. It will keep you out of trouble during difficult markets like the one we've been in this year. It will also help you make great money during bull markets.And the information is quite varied so the reader gets an intelligent view of the way markets are made, the way specialists work, the way of top trading strategies, and the way of the mutual fund business.In short, this is a great book for novice, intermediate, and advanced investors.I also recommend reading Market Wizards by Jack Schwager, though some of the interviews in those books are getting dated."
1,Good introduction to early California history,"This book covers the era when California (also known as Alta California) was a possession of Spain and Mexico. It is essentially a collection of first hand accounts from various people of this era.Since most, if not all, of these accounts were originally in Spanish, they require translation, and that is the book's one weakness: almost all the accounts read like they were written by the same person; some of the character of the individual writers is lost.Nonetheless, this is a good book, both readable and fast-moving. It is interesting that while we know a lot about the Revolutionary era and the founding of the United States, the topics in this book - which take place on the same continent at around the same time - are almost unknown. That, in itself, makes this book a good read."
0,Music Part did not work...,"could be just the one I purchased, but was one of the reasons I got it. Was not worth buying without."
0,Terrible,This thermometer does not give the accurate temperature(it reads 130 every afternoon and the actual temperature is about 85-90) and it does not stick to outdoor surfaces very well- it falls off when it rains. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
0,I wish I could get a response!,"I cannot review this Hairstyling Iron because although I was billed for it, I have never received it. I have sent emails to the seller and to Amazon and have had no response. My credit card company is now reviewing the charge. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with any item purchased through Amazon, and frankly, I am shocked that they have not done anything. I await a reply!"
0,Seriously . . .,"I am in no way a prude, but holy cow is this thing dangerous. The reason I am even looking it up on the web was because I was SURE there would be a recall on it. My wife got it for our 5 year old and besides not really cutting, it IS a tattoo needle. Can't think of any other reason to own it really except to do bad prison tats in your own home. Good thing my boy loves tattoos and we got him the pack of 500 tattoos(removable). I guess when he's older he can whip this thing out and get started on the real thing. Sheesh. Shame on you Crayola."
1,"The more you listen, the better it gets","The girl has grown up! Considering the other pop singers around when she came up especially, this album shows an amazing amount of thought, maturity, and nuance. The more I listen to it, the better it gets. ""Your Latest Mistake"" especially is a wry look at a break-up, and is so REAL. ""Most of Me"" just plain grown on you. Can't wait to see the next album."
1,So-So,"A perfectly good little book, but missing that, ""oh, my!"" factor that I ususally associate with books in the Blaze series."
0,Too Cold,"This is the worst Cold album ever.My favorite album is the first album13 ways to bleed on stage.The secondalbum wasn't that great but now they putout this crap which has no musical talenton it at all.It's slow,weak and depressing.There is not one heavy hard rockin'songon here.I wouldn't waste my time buyingthis album.Trust me this one sucks!!"
0,Skip this one,"Poorly filmed for a technical perspective, and the story was poorly written. Amateur-level acting with poor direction. Even if you are extremely bored, do not waste your time watching this movie."
0,Pure gossip,"If you want more information about the life of George Harrison, this book is DEFINITELY NOT the place to get it. It reads like something out of the National Enquirer. As is the case in most of his books, the author injects himself into it, in this case, making the most of a very short association with George, which his wife Olivia once described in a letter to a British newspaper as lasting ""about 10 minutes."" Because of that, the book has little in the way of solid information on George and actually deserves less than a one-star rating. How about a zero?"
1,"A good PDA, a bad price","While a bit weak compared to its more powerful bigger brothers, this is a passable PDA. The only problem is that it lacks the CF expansion port that has become so powerful as of late. Once the SD port becomes more expandable, this will be quite an adequate machine. Other things worth mentioning is that it is very light and has a very good screen..."
1,why not 7.1 ???????? technology gets better not worse,i am not sure why but i would have though it would be much easier to do a 7.1 mix on newer movies from 1994 to 2000 and beyond than movies dated from 1978 up till 1992 . well i belive its because of the lazy studies i mean come on . it may seem simple but if your gonna upgrade to blu ray then give us the full monty . and even with the original crew the first movie star trek sounded better thank the 2nd as each movie was watched the sound got worse and worse the first star trek sounds the best . this just dotn make sense the newer movies should sound better as they wear originaly mixed in 5.1 the older movies wear mixes in stnadered stereo so why is the older movies sound better than the newer ones makes no sense at all .
1,Dandy Warhols-Welcome to the Monkey House CD,"Great CD from 5-6 years ago. Bought the CD for the theme song from the Veronica Mars tv show (We Used to Be Friends). Saw the band live after buying the CD. Cd and band are an enjoyable listen. Wouldn't say I would sit and listen to the CD all the way through over and over, but there aren't many CDs I would. Transaction with the seller was easy and CD arrived safe and in great condition."
1,Well built and easy to use,"We actually bought two of these and have put them together to make a bigger version. This unit is REALLY meant to be used as shown, that shape is the most stable. If you do put two together the shape does not work out perfectly so we have used zip ties to attach the play yard to a railing to give it some extra stability. If you have wood or laminate floors you MUST use the pads or the play yard will slide all over the room.This has allowed us to give my son some room to play and it keeps him safe if I have to answer the door or go to the bathroom. He doesn't like to be in it all the time but there are times where he just plays for hours without even noticing I am sitting near by. It helps us contain the toys and it really helps contain him now that he is walking."
1,Good Printer,This printer came in a package i got about a year and a half ago and i just started using it in november of this year. it prints out good quality on BEST mode. on normal mode its really bad. my ink just ran out so 3 months or so the ink lasts. its time for me to upgrade but being a teenager i dont have the money.
1,Awesome Deal.,"I have to agree with everyone here. These shirts are outstanding. I workout six days a week and I like, better than anything else, clothes that don't wrinkle and don't look gnarly. This is totally true of these champions. I heard from a bunch of people that the Under Armor ones were great, but they were cost prohibitive. When I found out that I could get these ones at a far cheaper rate and of a similar material I jumped at the opportunity. I'm totally satisfied. They add to your appearance while retaining their shape and contour."
1,very comfortable shoes,My Mom has neuropathy in her feet and has a terrible problem with shoes. This shoe works very well for her. She wears a size 5WW which is very hard to find in shoe stores. I was able to get these on sale with Amazon's help. I couln't believe how quickly we received them... Great service....
1,Time for a New Edition,"I purchased this book in 2004 for it's original retail price of US$27.95. Now I see used copies selling for more than $300 on amazon.com. This book is a terrific analysis of what we now know, as the sub-title 'The Underrated Hazard' suggests, an extraordinarily prescient work outlining the causes and historical occurences of one of the earth's more destructive natural phenomenon, tsunamis.Please, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS, encourage Mr. Bryant to update this extraordinarily informative book with an analyse of the earthquake and tsunami of December 26, 2004."
1,Worked great!,"After an exasperating experience of selling my house to picky buyers I found myself replacing outlets... I got tired of being shocked by the end... so in a spot where originally had been two outlets, I wanted to put only one. After searching all over town for this product, I found it on Amazon... whala... problem solved... and buyers none the wiser."

0,A cult SF figure publishing a completely cult APA publishing flake nonfiction,"The author is enamoured with a cult/near children's level fiction genre, is at times a completely amoral/antisocial kook genre APA editor and gives us a tour de force of his nearly complete intellectual illegitimacy with this tome. Everything he touches is flaky or vicious/antisocial discussion tactics. I deplore the anti-semetic remark another derogatory reviewer employed, but this author is alienated minority thinking/ethics, sometimes at its worst. Unless you are a pathetic kook like most of The Connection, or a pathetic arrested development case like most hardcore SF fans, ignore this author solely on the basis of his content. Even the former should avoid this one on the basis of his unethical/self-pitying/alienated/vicious discussion tactics as well. The (Libertarian) Connection is finally dying off for lack of interest. Why does this have to stay in print?"
0,Christmas Village,"The Fisher-Price Christmas Village was a big disappointment. I bought for my 2-year old grandson. It basically did nothing! I also bought him the Hannukah Family, which lit up and played two songs and cost about half as much."
1,An excellent resource !,"In an enjoyable and insightful manner, authors Thompson and Ware present a compelling analysis of George W. Bush's leadership skills and techniques. In ten (10) concise chapters the reader is presented with an equal number of practical lessons that are applicable to leaders (or potential leaders) within most any type of organization. Starting with an examination of the fundamental core values that drive President Bush, the authors develop a useful guide that is loaded with practical ""real world"" examples and references. I personally found the chapter on Intuitive Wisdom to be very useful and thought provoking.This book also serves as a powerful and timely corrective to much of the partisan nonsense that has been published in recent years regarding President Bush's capabilities. For all those truly interested in improving their management skills and those seeking diversity in thought and opinion, this one is a must read!"
0,Not exactly romance...,"Some of this book is good, a lot of it is so angsty and horrifying that you can only laugh to keep from crying. My favorite line: ""my dear wife, even though I took a whip to you in the stable and raped you, you must understand that I really love you."" Seriously, that's what really happened. I was rooting for different pairings the entire time. The ""hero"" is a truly awful person and this book is just a mess. It's definitely not a feel-good romance."
1,This is great,"Hi im 11 years old, I am reading this book in school> This book is great. Once you start you get so into it. I think you should get this book! Show it to your children all you mothers because they need to know about how the Jews And the Nazis. It has plenty of vivid vocabulary. This is some great book. The best book I have ever read!!!!"
0,"Awful, awful, awful","I don't think I could say enough bad things about this book. The dialog was stiff and unnatural. The plot was supremely unbelievable. Not only that, you were annoyed with the underdeveloped, useless characters for the fact that they even believed that such rubbish could be going on around them. There was subplot inside subplot inside subplot, none of which made any sense or tied together in any logical way. Unbelievaly bad. The good news is, it serves to give aspiring authors hope: if this got published, anything can!"
0,Dreadful flavor,"Had high hopes for this coffee, as a reviewer stated that it had a natural coconut favor. It is dreadful. The product smells like coconut, but has an awful chemical taste. It has a hideous flavor coupled with sickening vanilla background taste. To top things off, it leaves a bitter after taste in your mouth. This product is not drinkable."
0,Ok book.,"To be honest, i really could not get into the book. the story started out slow and i lost interest fast."
0,"throw your money out the window, or buy a Samsung tv","WE bought this tv from amazon, took FOREVER to get it.hooked it up and got the picture to work signed the paperwork and sent the delivery guy on his way, only to find out a few minutes later that the sound does not work.SOOO now we call samsung wait 15 minutes (because they are very busy helping other callers)they tell us to reset the tv,and it worked!!! until I hung up the phone, then it had already stopped working.SOOO I call them again 15 minutes later I get to talk to someone now they are sending someone out to fix it(A MONTH AGO)SOOO I called again today,(only 2 minutes this time) and becouse we are out of the 25 mile max distance for repair service it has to be authorized by some MORRON at SAMSUNG 5-7 more days if someone doesnt call, call us back. (will be my 5th call).SOOO word to the wise... dont buy the samsung, throw your money my way or out the window, it will be less headache and problems.This raiting is 0 stars for Samsung and Amazon"
1,Excellent performance and recording,"The Akoustic Band, in my opinion, is a truly unappreciated piano trio in terms of Jazz History. The energy level of the three performers is worn on their sleeves, similar to the Oscar Peterson trio and Makoto Ozone of today. Chick Corea's style has been historically proven, and Pattituci's phrasing and solos are as exciting as Weckl's complex and impressive rhythmic ideas.A great buy."
0,junk@!!!,Total junk-majorly disappointed in Kat's first single--I expected better and more from her. Don't know if she just wasn't feeling up to putting forth the effort but as a fan i must say it's lacking in quality. Hopefully the next one will be better.
1,SOME GREAT GUITAR WORK ON THIS ALBUM,"RIDE THE LIGHTNING IS THE GREATEST METALLICA ALBUM ALONG WITH MASTER OF PUPPETS.THIS SUPERB ALBUM CONTAINS CLASSICS LIKE FADE TO BLACK,FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE,AND THE SUPER TITLE TRACK.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.A MUST IN EVERY CLASSIC ROCK COLLECTION."
1,Savory and inspiring recipes!,"I recently purchased this book and was immediately struck by the gorgeous photographs and mouth-watering recipes. Some are time-consuming, but Sarma and Matthew also provide quick recipes and advice for preparing raw food on the go. The organization and tasting/preparation notes make this book a great starting point for innovating in your raw (or vegan, or cooked, or ANY) kitchen. There is also a resource list in the back that directs the reader to sources for less common ingredients. These recipes will amaze you with their complexity and depth!"
1,Excellent New CD from Charmand Grimloch,"This Black Metal CD has excellent and outlandish keyboards of horror and mystery, blasting drums, strang lyrics.. what else could you want? yes i am silly."
1,A good movie,"forrest gump has got to be one of the best movie's of all time! it says it for itself. just watch the movie, and you too, will be moved. it's both funny and very emotional(especially when jenny dies and forrest's mommy). my fav. part is when forrest talks with forrest jr. at the bus stop. haley joel osment and tom hanks are so cute for their roles. tom hanks was BORN to play as Forrest Gump!"
0,"Doesn't Fit 42""","Says up to 42"" but not big enough for my Insignia LCD. Bummer, knew it was too good to be true."
0,Tower Heist,"Eddie Murphy's made a lot of bad films in the past couple of decades, and it's officially old hat to wax nostalgic about the glory days of Beverly Hills Cop and Coming to America. And while it would have been easy to dismiss Tower Heist as a probable bomb due to its outlandish premise, seemingly mismatched cast, and critically unimpressive director, well, it turned out to be another of 2011's pleasant surprises, thanks in large part to Murphy himself. The story centers on a group of luxury apartment employees who lose their pensions in a Ponzi scheme to a businessman and decide to take back what's theirs by ripping him off in an elaborate, well, tower heist. Aided by a star-studded cast that included Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Tea Leoni, Casey Affleck, and Gabourey Sidibe, Tower Heist represented a return to form for Eddie Murphy. It's a fun little popcorn movie that'll probably do a decent job of keeping you entertained on a Saturday night."
0,An unscientifc and pretencious book that does no good !,"It seems that most critisism against homosexuality comes from the Christian corner of society. Therefore it is especially sad that someone who has a ""Ph.D."" in his title is hiding his true religious prejudice before a mask of science. There is no cure for it, because it is not a disorder - any Christian who personally knows gays or lesbians AND uses his brain to think about it recognizes that. Please don't buy this book ! It is a threat to young gay people who are still unsure about their own being homosexual. By the way: To be gay and to believe in God is no contradiction. I live with it very well and thousands of other gays too - just think of all the homosexual priests ! Jesus is fun, but love, too."

0,arrived broken,"it arrived the morning we were leaving for a camping trip so I packed it in the car still boxed up. The hinge that keeps the grill closed up came broken. SO, the whole idea of a portable grill is sort of lost with this plastic tray flapping around and the grill doesn't stay closed.The grill itself worked great. We still used it on our trip and cooked almost every meal on it.My advice is to inspect it thoroughly before you end up on a trip with no other options!"
0,Rock? That was so funny I forgot to laugh!,"I like the songs, they're nice to listen to and i think she has a pretty nice voice on the cd. it's raspy just like mine. but if it's live i wanna rip my hair out, without all the enhancing done in the studio she's awful and i would rather eat dirt than listen to it. and she's definately not rock, that would require her to write her own lyrics AND music. she says she doesn't wanna be pop, well looks like that's what she is. another pop singer that can't sing live and couldn't write her own music if her life depended on it. maybe i'll use the cd as a coaster. hmmmm..."
0,I'm so disappointed,"Made the sourdough recipe twice (I thought perhaps I had made a mistake the first time). Both times it came rising out of the machine, stuck to the lid, down the sides, etc. I know my machine takes a maximum 1.5 pound loaf - and that's the recipe I used. 1.5 pound loaves bake OK with the cookbook that came with the machine. Finally got the recipe to work using 1/2 of the 2 pound recipe. Now I'm wondering if I have to recalculate all the recipes. I'm afraid to try any others."
0,"Seam Split, Causing a Nasty Burn","A few months after this item was purchased, one of the seams split where the thumb meets the hand (the ""vee""). I got a nasty burn because of this and cannot recommend this product. I suggest finding mitts that are seamless, or at least have seams in a less problematic place."
0,thumbs down on PSP 9,"Great software, but terrible (non-existent) support ever since Corel bought JASC. You can't e-mail PSP tech support anymore and to try to call to get an answer is absolutely ridiculous - Corel disconnected the 800 #, replacing it with a regular phone number which puts you on hold, but is never answered - (you could theoretically be on hold indefinitely). Version 9.0 had so many bugs in it that shortly after 9.0 was released, a 34 MB patch was available. However, since Corel trashed PSP support, they never bothered to notify PSP9 users that a patch was available - even if you had properly registered your software.My advice is to stay away from PSP9 (and any other Corel software) until they realize that good tech support is a major reason for continued customer loyalty and subsequent growth in sales."
0,do not buy this product! It is far worse than my English writting. Thats how bad it is!!,"I have never ever wasted my money on a porduct as bad as this dvd.Its a bunch of bull from the beginning to the end... no scientific facts or arguments just a 50 year old lady telling stories like.. if your upper lip is fat then you like to share youre feelings, while if you have a slim upper lip... than you like to be left alone! and this kind of bull will go on for 50 minutes.It is far worse than my English writting. Thats how bad it is!!"
1,Well Done!,"This was one of the better Reese Witherspoon movies I've seen in a while-- much better than the marginally watchable Sweet Home Alabama. The comic timing on this movie is dead-on, you like the main characters, it doesn't go the obvious places at times, and even the minor characters shine (especially Dina Spybey as Abby).While I still think Election is my favorite of Reese Witherspoon's movies, this is right up there."
0,Awful!,"I'm returning these sheets immediately. They are rough- not at all ""luxurious,"" and some of the cheapest quality I have ever seen. They are very poorly sewn and some of the seams were already coming apart right out of the package! I also bought a pair that I had intended to give as a gift, and those sheets are equally poor in quality, so I know that it was not just a fluke that I got a defective pair. I know I should have been more skeptical when the thread count was not advertised, but they seemed like such a great price. I am appalled that these sheets were ever offered at the original price, since I have seen much better quality for much less expensive. As a previous reviewer mentioned, they are not even worth the sale price!"
0,"Okay, but wasn't memorable","I know many people will terrorize our neighborhoods for saying this, but it wasn't the number one book we have ever read. Sure it was okay but it was predictable and shallow. The characters weren't endearing. So we could care less about them.This book is a mockery of romance, adventure and drama. But if you like parodies you have our blessing dive right in. Don't waste your money, borrow it."
0,Too Much Like an Episode- Get Generations,Insurrection was too much like an episode of Star Trek and not enough like a movie. It wasn't nearly as epic as Generations.
0,overpriced,"This video offers some useful information, but for the most part it simply reviews several fire making products, water purifying products, etc... it doesn't really discuss in detail any practical skills and the ones that are mention are vague. In my opinion it is over price given the amount of useful info it provides."
1,A readable treasure,"It's been 7 years since I've read this book.And it's changed my life. I assure you, it will change yours.This is not some fake gimmick like 'The Secret' is. This is true, basic, factual information on the thought process and how it influences our ego, our behavior, our lives, and most importantly, our sense of being.If you Wiki Eckhart Tolle, you will see an amazing story of a man who's passion for seeking answers to his existence enabled him to survive while being pushed to the brink, in a vat of depression, nearly committing suicide. In an instant, he was awakened with very simple truths that positively changed his life forever.His focusing on the 'Now' is a golden message unto all. A highly recommended book for those from all walks of life."
0,"Stale, Rancid Oil Taste, And if You Like Even the Tiniest Bit of Salt Flavor on Your Chips...","...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging ""peanuts"". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great ""premium"" brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!"
0,Black & Heck...this can opener sucks!,"I bought this and immediately had problems with it. I thought I was getting a good deal, but I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. It was not catching to open the cans, then it peeled and shredded the paper around the top, and then when it was scraping the top of the can (because it wasn't opening it) it was filing off tiny bits of metal. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to feed that to anybody. Not even my con-artist sister-in-law. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I called Black & Decker and they are replacing it for free. And when I told them that I just bought it they offered to pay for shipping as well."
0,"Be wary... Why ""bribe"" others into being your friend?","I agree that we don't need to flaunt the best things about ourselves, but I am upset that this book (and The Giving Tree) teaches children that they should give up the very things that make them special in order to have friends. If the other characters wouldn't be friends with Rainbow Fish simply because Rainbow Fish wouldn't give a piece of himself to them, then why should he want them as friends? What did they offer? Certainly not friendship! Talk about judging others! I like the story's attempt, but for a child, I think it backfires into a poor lesson!"
0,Clock died after one month,"We used this clock for a month and it worked great. However, it just died. Some sort of power problem. I am returning it."
0,Horrible book,"I am a student and this is frankly one of the worst textbooks I have had the displeasure of using. This textbook does very little to teach the reader how to work many of the problems and the writers seem to expect students to be able to figure problems their own or have the educator teach the students how to do a problem. This would be fine if all educators did this, but, unfortunately, they do not. I am in one such class. The professor seems to adhere to this book's philosophy and tests students on problems that he does not teach, similar to the book. The book does not help at all. I am completely lost and already failing, yet I do well in almost all other classes. This was a waste of $160."
1,No axes to grind,"Very well thought out information. I find sometimes, alternative medcial practitioners have an ""axe"" to grind or an anti establishment bias. I found none of that in this book. This was based on logic, studies, and experience. I have suffered from a ""root canal gone bad"" for over a year before I discovered this information. All the doctors and dentists just shook their collective heads while I was being poisoned by an infected root canal tooth. Even after I had it removed, the problem continued. It had tranferred to my jaw and other areas of my jaw. Without this info, I do not know where I would be at this point. I am seeking the proper care and expect a great improvement."
1,Simple enough for children; arousing enough for adults,"Frequently used as a child's book, this tale of a house pet transformed into an Alpha male dog in the wild will waken your senses into what being wild can be all about. Simple word structures, emotional prose, certainly a classic piece that is likely to never be forgotten."
0,An annoyingly awful show,"I hated this show when it first aired and I still hate it today. The scripts are idiotic slapstick; the premise is absurd, the acting is annoying."
1,"Love, love this music!",I had this in cassette so I was thrilled to be able to buy this in CD so I can continue to enjoy it!
0,Movie stunk- HDDVD was good...,"The movie itself was not very good. It was like watching a Lifetime channel movie with bad neighborhood fosterhome brothers inserted. There wasn't as much action or ""revenge action"" as I was hoping for and the script was not that great. On the HD side, things were better. The video transfer is great and shows the cold side of Detroit very well including all the blue-ish hues of the winter. No signs of artifacts and mostly very sharp. The sounds is fine also w/ just DD+ or Dts to choose from.An OK movie with a good, crisp looking HD transfer."
0,to catch a thief,"I enjoyed this book, but also felt the author is a little to close to the subject, and has not much objectivity. Also, I think, being it's a book about the Fitzgeralds, she should have cribbed a few passages from The Great Gatsby. I would loved to have been reading about old Papa Kennedy conning Gloria Swanson, and discovered he had ""temporarily lost interest in the abortve sorrows and short winded elations of men."" If you're going to steal, Doris, might as well go the whole hog."
0,Help This Song,"There are just so many songs now or days that sample great music from the past, and seems to turn it into pudding. That has been the problem with so many acts like Jennifer Lopez, Ashanti, and now Rihanna. Her latest single, S.O.S., samples the 80's classic Soft Cell's Tainted Love. Rihanna's track doesn't really have the feeling of a great dance song here. It just sounds terrible. While her last singles Pon De Replay, and If It's Lovin' That You Want were fairly welcomed guilty pleasure tracks, this song doesn't capture a new singer in their prime. I think she needs to try to find better songs to make her appeal more known.Song: D+"
1,"American Literature Teachers, Do Yourselves a Favor.",Have your students read this book. Alexie's prose is beautifully simple with a rhythm they can sway to. Have them use his text as a model for their own personal narratives...and enjoy.
1,YUM!,"OK- I want to cook almost all of these recipes. (I make exceptions for brains and sweetbreads.)All the rest though? Brilliant. I plan to start a salted and dried pork liver in the next couple of days.Also- if you want to do a proper haggis for Burns Day- here's a recipe!More seriously- though I may try a haggis at some point- there's a really thorough discussion of confit and how we can do it.I have never thought I'd want to cook tripe... but I'm getting intrigued.This book really encourages one to expand beyond one's usual preconceptions. Even before getting the book, I've tried a couple of the more conventional recipes, and they've been great. I look forward to trying the catsup recipe- I've been looking for a solid catsup recipe that would substitute for commercial.Recommended, even if only for inspiration!"
1,"The Unsung, Unacknowledged Heroines of This Album","F.Y.I. Fans: The talented background vocalists on Juvi's song ""My Life"" are the lead singers from En'Dera, Cash Money's first girl group on the label. Subsequently, the group was dropped, but the beautiful vocals remain, with the singers unacknowledged. They deserve recognition for their art, even if they never receive a dime."
0,Not a first choice for me,I just could not get interested in the characters. I found it to be very slow moving. Too much narrative
0,Quality has really dropped,"I have used this same line of shavers for over 30 years and I was always very happy with them. I bought this to replace the prior model, that began to fall apart and was much poorer quality than previous versions. This one is a major step down. These razors were always loud and missed whiskers, but they gave a close shave and they were convenient. This one is really loud, loud enough to wake up family members sleeping on another floor of the house. Also, this particular one only works on the battery, not when plugged in with the cord. It still gives a close but much less comfortable shave, worse than a blade. It is also suppose to be washable but when I ran the heads under the tap the whole housing leaked water from the cracks. It still ran but I worry about safety and durability. As a loyal customer for a very long time I am really disappointed."
1,Still the definitive work on the Kennedy assassination and it's aftermath...,"However, given the large number of positive reviews here, most of which I agree with, it's worth noting that this book was published around the time there was considerable dissatisfaction and questions being raised about the findings of the Warren Commission and that Manchester I feel, truly gives short shrift to Lyndon Johnson and the transition that took place. To suggest that this was an easy time for Johnson or that there was some desire on the part of the Vice-President to usurp power without regard to the feelings of the Kennedy family or Bobby Kennedy in particular is utter nonsense. Upon reading this material I suggest people also give Max Holland's 'The Kennedy Assassination Tapes' a read as well. Holland's compilation of the taped discussions between Johnson and others in the days and years after Nov. 22 tell a very different story than what Manchester would have us believe."
1,Inner Strength without Resistance,"In ""Unlikely Teachers,"" Judy Ringer guides us from inner resistance to inner acceptance. Judy's open hearted anecdotes and gentle words of guidance bring the reader from everyday instances of personal and circumstantial conflict to the possibility of connection and personal discovery. What makes ""Unlikely Teachers"" such a 'likely teacher' is that on top of the contemplative wisdoms it is a veritable ""how to"" book. Aided by specific and detailed practices, Judy discusses the specifics of becoming aware of and disengaging from conflict, how to redirect our thinking and behavior, and especially how to begin to allow ourselves true empowerment, an inner strength without resistance."
0,Complete Waste of Time,"This book is a complete waste of anyones time, trust me. The person who wrote this book must have written the other reviews himself, or had his students do it for extra credit. If this is the first book you read as an aspiring screenwriter you might find in a little interesting, but there really is nothing to this book but the very basics of screenwriting drawn out into 200+ page book. This books is so overwritten. Every point that could have been made in this book could have been made into a bulleted list and been 5 pages long.If you want to be a screenwriter this book will teach you absolutely nothing. Find another book to read, go online and read screenplays and learn from them instead!"
1,A Book for Every Teacher,"Whether you teach math, English, science, or any discipline in a school, this book will make you a BETTER teacher. In addition, when you apply Tovani's suggestions, your students will IMPROVE. This book is worth taking personal time outside the classroom to read. It will make your time in the classroom more purposeful."
1,Almost iconic,"A nice, easy to install gauge from auto meter. Matches most Amber lit gauges well.Would be a huge improvement if it was back lit, if you're picky about that keep looking"
0,Mine broke,This cable worked fine for a month and then it broke. The casing for the part that connects to the phone came apart and I couldn't put it back together. It's not as well made as the actual cables from Apple.
1,A Must See!,The original Transformers movie has some of the most creative and spectacular special effects ever recorded on film. It is a must see for any Sci-Fi enthusiast. The details create a multitude of emotions throughout the movie. Even people that are not particularly interested in Sci-Fi movies will enjoy this film. It is well worth the time and I think it is most excellent! I am looking forward to the release of the sequel.
1,Excellent for Astro Photography,I bought this remote with the intent of using it for taking Astrophotography Pics with my Nikon D50 DSLR. Just as I imagined my pictures are at least ten times as still as they would be if I pushed the shoot button on the camera myself.
1,recommended for all audiology students,"perfect for any audiology studentGives a detailed overlook on hearing aids, how they work and the key implications of their use"
0,Not what we'd hoped,"Not terribly effective. The flame seems not really hot enough to actually kill many of the local weeds and grasses, though it looks scary to the neighbors, who think we're about to start a brush fire. (This is Southern Arizona.) The device is also awkward to use without getting a proper propane tank dolly. I tried to gerry-rig a tank tied to a hand-truck. Didn't really work, though it might with a hand-truck of a different design. The one Red Dragon offers costs more than the Weed Dragon itself. Might be worth it if the flame system really did the job with the weeds, but that doesn't seem to be the case -- around here, anyway."
0,The Last Official Byrds Studio Album.,"As far I am concerned The Byrds are the greatest band of all time.Therefore for me to give 2 out 5 stars indicates that something is seriously wrong.I have owned this CD for some years and have just played it again.I can only recommend 2 songs, which are Full Circle, and (See The Sky) About To Rain, and neither can be described as must haves.With the best will in the world this must be the least important album to have, so if you don't know The Byrds, please try any other of their many releases."
1,"Not the ""Best"" But Very Good","I needed some Star Trek video for a presentation I'm doing at work. This video worked out fine for that. If I was buying it as representative of the ""Best of Star Trek"" I might be a little disappointed. They were good episodes, though one of them featured the crew traveling to the old west and dressed as cowboys for much of the episode which was a let down. Still, it was entertaining viewing."
1,Best Live DVD Ever Released,"Killswitch's first dvd is all that I expected and more-- it features an amazing 75 minute concert with a great set list featuring many old and new songs. The concert is very good, as usual Adam D. and the rest of the band own live with great stage prescence (Adam D. does pushups during one break in the song), and the documentary is even better. The documentary is also over an hour long and talks about the bands history, starting from when the members were in separate bands, and tells you anything you ever wanted to know about Killswitch Engage. And you won't be let down by the bonus features! Buy this DVD you will watch it over and over again."
1,Mixed Bag of the Good and the...,"Like the previous volume Chabon edited, many of the stories seem to miss their aim. Despite claims to the contrary, many of these tales are bogged down by the exact literary trends and pretension that inspired this collection (and the previous) as a reaction against. There are some outstanding stories--Ayelet Waldman's ""Minnow"", China Mieville's ""Reports of Certain Events in London"", and Jason Robert's ""7C""--that accomplish that thrilling edge-of-your-seat anticipation that inspired so many young folks to become lifelong readers. Many of the other stories are mostly good but seem to not exactly fit into this anthology. I will say that I loved the stories by the inimitable David Mitchell and Jonathan Lethem and would suggest picking up this volume for those alone."
0,price/effectivness analysis,the cock roaches liked this more than me. the duration of the effect on the insects was not more than a few hours. not sufficient for home defense and i'm wondering why this product is so ineffective.
0,don't get this if you're a small person,"nobody likes slings or braces so i thought i'd try this one in spite of mixed reviews. i'm 5'3"",112 lbs, 46 years old. my horse bucked me off, broke my collar bone. the picture of this shoulder immobilizer looked comfortable, but i took it off after about six hours. it's super hot-not in a good way-bulky, and won't get cinched up good enough on a small person. maybe i'll try it again in a week or two, but for now... :-("
0,This book begs to be ignored,"I read through this book and learned more about how inadequate the author feels than about anything else. This book is full of generalization, politically correct tripe, and features a disclaimer for the anti-marriage crowd.I would prefer a book from someone who offends me and takes a position, over a book (like this one) where the author is a coward and refuses to say anything that might be considered politically incorrect.Not surprising that this author ends the book with a section on how to survive a divorce."
0,Nice ideas. Not so nice recipes,"I love the title of the book. I love the pictures. I love the ideas it has (esp. the chocolate cabbage). But at least a few of the recipes haven't worked for me. I've made the cabbage cake at least 3 times and I've given up on the sponge cake core. It comes out pretty dense, and I use another sponge cake recipe.Another recipe, chocolate honeycombs, says to mix the wet and dry ingredients and then cook to a simmer. With twice as much dry as wet ingredients, there is no way you can simmer this.So I would actually recommend the book, but take everything it says with a block a salt."
0,Not that pleasant,"I don't like to write bad reviews, so I will just tell you that this book was not so entertaining. The story is miserable."
1,"Facinating, Imaginative and Fun!","I loved this book so much that I devoured it in 5 hours! The imagery was outstanding. I felt as though I was watching a movie unfold in my mind. It was one of the most captivating and magical fantasy stories that I have read, and recomend it to anyone, young and old alike."
1,Best and Most Realistic Horror Film of the Year!,"The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing ""The Haunting"" tonight. The scarriest part about it is that it is so realistic. You feel like you know the people and that you are there in the house with them! One of the best parts is the Special ""Behind the Scenes"" portion on the DVD. We really enjoyed this part of ""The Mummy"" but this was even better. A movie in itself! A good movie for a cold winter night (the kids will certainly join you on the couch!)"
0,Too many new moves!,"I have done Jillian's 30 Shred and found this product to have too many moves forced into such a short time. The yoga moves were too rushed, she rotated between moves too quickly, and frankly I felt like I couldn't concentrate on form and quality and was being pushed towards injury. I have returned to the Shred and also added Tony Horton to the mix. What's up with those girls helping her out anyway?"

1,Leander is sooooo hot,"OMG!! He has an incredible voice, I just love him!!! Hmmm those bedroom eyes are soo seducing...Please get this album, the music is very soothing."
0,Not a practical guide,"Unless you plan to have an agricultural based farm, using draft horses, DON'T Bother With This Book. It is an interesting read on horse powered farming, no practical advise, no ""setting up"" or design of a farm included. Why this title, I haven't a clue. I've never submitted a review to Amazon before, but I felt that the title of the book was so misleading that it was important to do so."
0,Not what the title says,"This book does give you a good idea on many normal questions. The problem is that more than half the questions that are used in this book are either illegal or questionable. Ones such as how would you handle a tough workplace situation are not answered.There is also a strong female bent, with questions about working with or planning a family, again questions which border on being against labor law.I did learn some things from this book, but I would say 20% of the book was relevant to me."
1,Perfect for small omelettes,"I have a 12 inch cast iron skillet that was a bit too big for everyday use, especially when making omelettes for my kids (small sized), so I ordered this skillet. It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I use it all the time: grilled cheese sandwich, omelette, melt butter, small quesedilla, etc. I really do wish Lodge made one between the 12 inch and 8 inch skillets, maybe 10 inch? Anyway, this size is great if you have small children or cook only for yourself."
0,Feel like bashing it with a hammer until it is in little pieces,"The first four months this heater worked great - none of that switching on and off, just steady heat as long as I wanted it. Now it is useless or at least the thermostat is. When I first switch it on it will work for a few minutes, then it will switch on and off every second, sometimes 50 or more times in a row (I lost count). It will make a starting sound like its going to go and then switch off immediately, then start again and stutter again. If I am very lucky it will stay on for 10 seconds. So basically I'll get 5 minutes of heat and then it stutters on and off for the next half an hour, until I switch it off in frustration. Money well spent!"
0,Oh the Pain... the pain.,"G'Day from down under!!! Now listen, mate... first they release the complete first season, then while everyone eagerly awaits the release of season two, we're all told it's going to be released in two parts.... hello!? They say there are 4 discs in the second season..RUBBISH. If you buy THE COMPLETE second season from the UK, there are 8 discs containing 30, yes THIRTY episodes in the second series and rumour has it there will be a further releaase in January 2006. Not to mention the packaging that leaves the region 1 partial release for dead. So the mind boggles as to why the boffins at FOX are going to split up season 2 and 3 into small chunks... Oh the pain, the pain..."
1,Great photo quality!!,"I was worried about spending 500.00 for a printer, which I knew nothing about, but after reading reviews on Google.com I felt comfortable about doing it. The quality comes out great. You can't go wrong with getting this printer. One thing I did notice, it left a scratch on my prints, when I printed 4X6 images. I have not had a chance to see if it was a one time fluke or what. I'm waiting for more paper to arrive."
1,"Great for walking support, and more!","Our daughter used this for balance when beginning to walk, and now that she walks independently, she still pushes it around! She loves the telephone feature, and will sit quietly pushing the buttons and using the other features. The lights, sounds and music are cheerful and hold her attention. The activity portion also detaches from the walker, so your child can play with it flat on the floor."
0,Review after 6 months,My opinion of the product+ Durable and easy to set up+ large enough for both my girls to play in comfortably-The add on products are very not very good. They may look cool but they are not as durable (always falling apart) and are not much fun for the kids to play with-This toy takes up way to much room-Even put in the stored postition it still takes up a lot of roomMy girls loved this for about the first 2 weeks. Since they have totally lost interest. I believe that with better accesories it would be very good. They are not durable and really do not encourage play.The house is very durable and well made.
1,as promised,dvd player is good and as discribed on internet...same price as walmart but no shipping charge and NO GAS...

0,"soggy, brown salad",I bought this with high hopes. I had a lettuce keeper that kept my salad crisp and fresh for a week. I bought this product and have been terribly dissappointed. I will buy a bag of salad and store it. Within a day or two the lettuce is brown and wilted. Unhappily I need to purchase a different one.
1,We have choices!,"This film will remind you that you have choices in life. You can either continue to think negatively and bring doom and gloom and negative people into your life or you can change your thinking and be the happy productive person you were meant to be. For me, I am learning to accept responsibility for my life and it has made all the difference. I choose to no longer be a victim of my circumstances."
1,Monster,"Steve is a 16 year old boy growing up in Harlem. He decides to help out a robbery of a local drug store. While he wasn't there while the crime was committed, he helped by being a lookout and did a terrible job. He was then charged with felonious murder because he helped in the crime. Throughtout this gut-wrenching novel you jump from the jail cell to the courtroom. The thing that makes this book so good is that for the whole novel Walter makes you decide if Steve is guilty or not. To find the outcome out you'll just have to read this suspense thriller yourself."
1,Some of Janis Joplins great songs,"It is Janis Joplins group, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Janis Joplins songs are now taking off. Her career is cut short by a drug overdose while on a concert tour. Many of our singers and sports stars cannot handle the sudden influx of a lot of money and we lose them to drugs and airplane crashes and car crashes."
0,Broke after 6 months,I like the overall look and design of the product but my opinion went down veryquickly when the unit began to malfunction.- Opens by itself- Opens and closes continuouslyI'm not amused either when I have to pay freight both ways to get a replacement. What's with a replacement top direct from the company costing almost as much as an entire new unit from Amazon?This company needs to improve itself in two ways: Customer service and quality. Without these two areas in place the company is doomed.Oh yes - I tried cleaning it. I tried taking out the batteries and putting fresh ones in twice.
0,Levis changed the fit,"In the last year or so these jeans were changed from regular fit to straight fit. This new fit appears to be intended for someone with no butt. The rise in back is lower as well. I've been wearing 505's for decades, but when I tried these new jeans on they were instantly uncomfortable. I have returned them for a refund."
1,Nice Overview of Community Sociology,"This book makes an nice contribution to the area of community sociology. It offers theoretical discussions, methodological insights, and linkages to other disciplines."
1,"One of the Year's best, period.","Splendid sophomore effort by Ms. Imbruglia. Her sound has really matured, and the entire CD flows very organically. This is one of those CD's that is worth paying the import sticker price for, since it won't be in the US until post 02.As for the guy who complained about the CD protection, there is a proprietary program on the CD which only allows you to play it and not rip it. That said, you can listen to it using WinAmp, Real Jukebox and others. So chill out and review the music, not the CD."
1,"Extremely exciting, brilliantly written.","This is an extremely exciting book about the use of psychics in the spy war between the superpowers. It is brilliantly written, with an almost poetic language. I speed read it in two days. I just could not stop. Highly recommended"
1,Great Value for the Price,Most of the new tv's (all 2012 Samsung) only have digital optical audio out now so I needed an optical cable to play my tv with the surround audio system when streaming. This was a great deal and works fine.
0,Not for me,"I can see why young and pre-teens would like this book. Too young for my taste. Story not all that interesting. Found it kind of goofy in parts. Kept thinking ""oh come ON!"""
1,The perfect break tool. Easy to use and very durable.,Perfect tool. I use it all the time and i love it. the guys at my job all have one and i had to have one of my own.
0,worst ever,This is the worst tea pitcher in the world. The tea maker is ok. I got it a year ago and have replaced the pitcher 11 times at 10.99 ea online plus shipping. Its just not worth it. I will get a diferent one this time. It cracks over and over. Its horrible. Don't get it. It's not worth it.
1,You can't go wrong with these shoes.,"Hey, these are Fila. My son love these shoes and for him are his 'special' occassion shoes! He suggests we get him another pair in a larger size as he is 11 years and still growing."
1,Great Textbook for Intermediate Economics,One of the few textbooks I didn't return. This book is amazing for breaking down economic theories and providing excellent examples to some of the most challenging equations. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is having trouble grasping intermediate economic equations.
1,"ambitious subtitle, but certainly a nice collection","Several years ago, upon learning that a certain young woman enjoyed the poetry of Robert Frost, I began to memorize some of Frost's poetry. While this effort to impress her did not produce the desired outcome, it did introduce me to the pleasurable experience of memorizing poetry. I found that the act of committing a poem to memory brought out many of the poem's subtleties that I missed on previous readings. It's been quite a while since I've seen the lady who inspired my efforts at memorizing poetry, but I still enjoy coming to a closer understanding of a poem through memorization.It's hard for any poetry fan to take someone else's list of the ""100 best"" without balking at some of the choices, and I certainly had some question concerning many of the poems included in the anthology. On the whole, however, I enjoyed the collection, and found some new insight into some old poems."
0,The Grand Master--But Not Yet,"Let me be honest about this. This is the first RAH book that I could put down. I have been a Heinlein fan since I read ""Time for the Stars"" when I was 11 years old. I have read every piece of work that came from his pen, and I loved them all! However, ""For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs,"" is ponderous, heavy and dull. I forced myself to read it through, and frankly, dull is the best thing I can say about it. Stolid also comes to mind.Robert Heinlein proved that he was better than this. But this, his first novel, should have been edited down to a short story, and been published in one of the compilations along with some of his other shorts."
1,Nice colors (blue/black),"This Shemagh is pretty cool. It's a decent thickness, and has a pretty sweet pattern to it. I have watched a few videos online, showing how to tie it correctly, and I can do it for the most part. I bought the blue/black one, because lately I've been seeing lots of the green/black ones and other colors - but, not blue. I just gotta be different ya know. Anyway - this is a very nice product. I'd recommend it to anyone."
0,wrong!!!!!!!,jesus is not a myth. just read the bible and u will find out that jesus is not a myth. the bible is a true book. i think this is nonsence. jesus suffered greatly. he felt real pain and humans feel pain. jesus is the savior of the world and my world. he died so we can live. this author is a bunch of crap he dosent know what hes talkin about.
1,"So funny it inspired us to create ""Crab""","Cow's adventures inspired us to create our own book called ""Crab"" while on vacation. Our first & only reading of the book made us laugh out loud. Later that day while walking on the beach we decided to write our own story about Crab. The project gave us hours of laughter and a great project while on vacation. The book is our favorite souvenir!"
0,Kid's Heart Review,"Beautiful quality book, but would not interest my grandsons. May be more of a girls choice."
0,Don't Get A Kindle,"I've had the Kindle for 3 months now. It is really one of the worst gifts I have ever received. The buttons are clunky, the 3G and internet is awful, and the books and subscriptions are way overpriced. If you have a library, usually the card is free and you can get almost any book ever printed (audio or otherwise)within a few days. Until this Kindle thing (and probably any of the other digital readers) becomes more refined, I'd not waste the up front cost and the cost of the digital books. In summary - way over priced for the product and the content, slow, and poorly designed."
0,there are better ways of getting a good nights sleep,"Please, before you read this book, consider Merideth Small's new book ""Our Babies, Ourselves."" Children are biologically designed to sleep with adults. It may not be in our culture, but for our babies sakes, we can change our culture. Trust me. I became a 3rd time mother at 43, via c-section. If anybody ever craved a good nights sleep, it was me. The baby sleeps in our bed and everybody is happy. She wakes up, nurses and goes back to sleep. I used Ferber with my 2nd child and I'm still apoloogizing 11 years later. This is not, repeat, not in any way the proper method for getting babies to sleep.Sure, Ferber's a doctor, but so was Mengele."
1,Love the design,I pick this design because if my baby girl gets here and is a baby boy I don't have to change my crib set. And I already have animals up on the wall from my daughter who is 7 now and more into Barbie and makeup.
0,Just unnecessary,"This book, while written by two renowned computer scientists, is truly disappointing. In trying to discuss randomness and computation, this book just does a mediocre job on discussing randomized computation and also an equally poor job discussing relevant aspects of probability theory. Their approach is not novel and many of their examples can be found in other texts. If you really want to learn randomized computation, get Motwani et al's book on Randomized Algorithms. If you want to learn probability theory, get any advanced probability theory book like Spencer and Alon on the probabilistic method, one of Sheldon Ross's books, or even Grimmett and Stirzaker. Whatever you do don't get this weak hybrid of a book that will require you to get another book at some point to supplement your understanding."
1,"""Hail"" to the kings","Thank god they game back. Kelly Hansen is the ax master. This is their best CD in a long, these bad boys roar in with F5 fury. Freakin' unforgetable, there is no eye to this record. Hail to the Kelly ""The King"" Hansen. Let it rain, let it RAIN!"
1,Beyond awesome!!!,"This is one of the most beautiful Christmas CD's I have ever heard--and I am quite a conniseur of Christmas music. Even the Christmas songs that are not my favorites, like White Christmas, are beautiful. They sing each song with so much richness, with their own unique spin that makes it original, yet recognizable. The orchestration, blending of voices, solos, everything comes together so exquisitely, in such a moving way. On a scale of 1-10, I would give this an album a 20. In a world of violence and darkness, this takes you away from it all, into a world of beauty, peace, and joy. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and be prepared for a real treat!"
1,Finally!,I'm SO glad to finally find a lot of the songs I've been looking for. Even in MP3 a lot of these are hard to find. Can't wait till my copy arrives! THANK YOU to whomever created this collection! The hard to find songs I grew up with I can finally listen to. Check them out for yourself!
1,"New Perspectives Good, and Traditionally Based","As a student of 'standardized' TCM, I find Mark Seem's approach refreshing. Doctors of old examined the body with their hands, and directly percieved the subtle Qi and it's state within the body. Actually palpating the body and seeing the truth and information there, instead of intellectually deciding on a diagnosis via symptoms of the patient(accuracy questionable), is something we can all learn from....that is, the hands on approach."
1,The gratest mc right now,Jay-z is one of the best rappers in the world and he tells everybody about his life in his rimyes
0,"Drains batteries, no option for AC adapter","Why it needs to store date, time, etc is beyond me.Every time I take mine out, I need new batteries.There is no option to use an AC adapter to alleviate this issue. So, long-term this unit will be expensive to maintain, or be unreliable since battery status can't be trusted."
0,Not much REBIRTH on this album...,"Jennifers singles are those types of singles that you enjoy listening to on the radio...but would hate admitting it to friends that you like them. J Lo has had the problem of good singles but a lot of filler in her albums. The only tracks which show a different direction are GET RIGHT (Those horns are genius!...and the version with Fabolous is better), HOLD YOU DOWN (Good song for you and your boo) and STEP INTO MY WORLD (Very sexy and Middle Eastern feel to it). Unfortunately this album is not worth it...there are only two or three decent songs. So what else is new for J Lo albums?"
1,What I was looking for in a magical cat book,"""The Enchanted Cat"" by Ellen Dugan is exactly the book I had been hoping for back when I ordered ""Cat Magic: Mews, Myths and Mystery"" by Patricia Telesco (and was very disappointed).Ellen Dugan covers a bit of feline history and lore, yet is able to apply it to the present with spells and activities you can do now with your cat(s). A variety of spell subjects are covered that include your cat(s) and/or hairs shed from your cat. There's a kitten blessing, feline naming ritual, listing of names (with a witchy slant) for cats and their meanings. The back of the book contains a ""workbook"" and journal with subject headings. Ellen Dugan really nailed this one!"
1,Must-Have CD,"I bought this CD before Christmas 2006 and I have been listening to it almost everyday ever since.This is a great CD. All the songs are great. My favorite is ""Where Did My Baby Go"". But the rest are equally good."
0,Did this book make money?,"One of the people at my work brought two unread copies of this into work yesterday. Some of the jokes were funny, but the distortions were never ending. I really wonder if tripe like this makes any money? Is there a web site like IMBD for books where you can look at the gross numbers?"
1,Great Movie!!!,"I don't know why this got such bad reviews from some people but, it was great! We watched it from beginning to end. True....the story was a bit weak and they didn't catch you up from the last movie but it was still a great movie. Lots of action, a few twists and turns. It's worth it."
0,Great for non-professionals or students,"I am a professional Hairdresser at a reputable Day Spa in Northern California. I have used many brands of shears ranging in cost from $70 to $1200. Although I have heard the saying ""you get what you pay for"", I figured that I would give these shears a try to keep on hand as a spare. I really should have listened to that old rule of thumb. The shears I am sure would be quite suitable for students or non -professional household use, but arent salon quality. I guess I will know better for my next purchase, and stick to Beauty shows and known sellers before I outsource to Amazon or private sellers.Just a heads up to future buyers, I could be incorrect, but I dont believe that this seller accepts returns. I will check into it however."
1,Another triumph for French Canadian film,"It is films like ""Jésus de Montréal"", ""Le Confessional"", ""Léolo"" and many others that demonstrate the brilliant work being done in Francophone Canada.There is a pinch of French Canadian culture that may have foreigners scratching their heads but aside from that the story is quite universal. A general knowlege of the bible will enrich your viewing experience a great deal. Arcand's not so subtle but at the same time not too obvious critique of religion and mondern culture is brilliantly achieved.Great performances all around, memorable scenes, interesting plot and a unexpected but very logical ending.Even the humour works well.A must see especially for those interested in Canadian film."
0,Fake Looking for the price.,I bought this border to create a flower bed and I have to agree that the slate gray is very fake looking. I ended up spray painting it white and it doesn't look as bad. Definitely not something I would have bought had I seen it in the store.
1,Suprisingly yummy!,"My experiences with health and energy bars have been mixed. Most of the ones I've tried are pricey, taste terrible, and make me feel like I've swallowed powdered cement. So, I was cautious about Pure Bar. My general view, based on experience, is that the healthier and more ""organic"" it is, the worse it's going to be and this one is jam-packed with things like organic dates, organic cashews, organic rice protein concentrate, and other organic healthy stuff--so it couldn't possibly be delicious, right? Wrong. I was pleasantly surprised after the first bite hit my taste buds. These things are really good! Unlike most health bars I've tried, these are chewy and moist--not hard and dry. I don't have to wash this down with a drink in order to get it from my throat to my stomach, and there's no nasty aftertaste. And, the price is definitely reasonable! I'll be buying more of these for sure."
1,Great Book,I have not read anything before by Dickson. I like Christian suspense novels. The story is great shows how two women when they were younger witness a murder. I like how he introduces the characters in the book and how there are strange murders going on. I like the way the story builds in the book hard to keep from putting the book down. I really enjoyed this book
1,Fantastic,"I think this game is as good as Guild Wars.Not only new type of armors and characters are very fantastic,but also new environments and user interface are very successful."
1,Fun,"Akimbo's not the greatest, granted. But it does allow access to programming not normally available to the regular television viewer. Akimbo's cool because you get original programming and favorites from top tv networks, plus the service continues to improve. If on-demand is the future of television, this is a sneak-peak."
1,3.5 Stars,"Sentenced has put out a very listenable album to end their career. Most of the songs take on a death theme, but I don't get the sense that they were very sad while making this cd. In fact, it seems like they were just doing what they loved and isn't that how we all want to die?"
1,jackson's movie,"was an awesome movie Jackson was really hot in it an played a good part,a good suspence thriller,worth watching again,it will catch you off guard"
0,Bitter pill,"As Alanis further buries her career by deciding to release her albums *exclusively* at Starbucks, smart record stores, like HMV here in Canada, pull her music from shelves until she releases her music in music stores, not coffee stores.They shouldn't have bothered to restock the shelves, especially this cash grab collection of ""acoustic"" versions of songs from her 1995 album, Jagged Little Pill. Granted, you can find a number of these songs performed acoustically on some of her CD singles from Jagged Little Pill, including her 1996 performance of ""You Oughta Know"".This is a step back, not a step forward for Alanis. Next: the Nostalgia tour. And the artist is not even 35...."
1,Great Film,"Incredibly insightful, great interviews by people who were close to Hank, who could tell you not only what he said, but also what was in his mind."
0,empty package,"I ordered this for my sons birthday, the package arrived empty. He did not get his drumsticks after I promised that he would. He was sad and I looked like a real bad"
0,Kind of dry and slow...,"This is a great story, and very moving. But it isn't nearly the movie I expected. It feels like Meerkat Manor more than a feature length movie production - with voices (unknown) letting us know what the various characters are thinking and feeling. And for younger children, it is definitely too slow-moving and dry to hold their attention. My five and three year olds will watch most movies all the way through - especially my five year-old who devours movies. But this just didn't hold their attention and barely held my attention. I was honestly disappointed."
1,This is an incredible set of Sci Fi Radio,"This set contains six discs featuring 16 different futuristic science fiction audio dramas by various authors.The clamshell binder holds the cds in sleeves which you might want to convert to slim cd cases for protection.Disc One:Blood by Frederic BrownBy His Bootstraps by Robert A. HeinleinThe Choice by Wayland YoungDisc Two:RUR by Karel KapekDisc Three:Bloodchild by Octavia E.

Van Vogt""Repent Harlequin"" Said the Ticktockman by Harlan EllisonThese full cast audio productions are crystal clear on CD and feature humorous introductions by Harlan Ellison who hosts the series. Highly Recommended!"
0,An evil approach to child rearing,"This book should be called, ""Dare to be Abusive""! This guy's advise on child rearing is evil! Books like this should be boycotted!"
0,"I would have given this product a zero, but I had to rate it with at least a one","This product does not work the way that it says it does. It was a complete waste of money. Specifically, the ignitor does not trigger the flame as it is supposed to. I do not recommend this product."
1,"SCARY AS HELL, BUT ULIMATELY UPLIFTING","Given the current world stage, this book really scared the hell out of me. Frank wrote it in 1957, but there is very little about it that feels dated. A dogfight gone wrong sets the stage for global disaster, which we live through in our hero, a wayward ex-Army borderline alcoholic living in a serene Florida small town. The characters and situations that play out in the aftermath of total nuclear war are amazingly true and captivating. The attention to crucial survival details never flags (you'd never know how important salt would be until you really need it). But in the end, it's really a tribute to the human spirit and a testament that we are, by nature, mostly good at heart. I loved this book and wish there were more out there like it."
1,"It was really cool, he thinks he is kidnapped at birth","It was really neat, I would present it to all who belive in imaginatio"
0,The Original Soundtrack was changed.,This is a classic and someone decided to change the Original Soundtrack.It has different songs and voices. This is not what I thought it was going to be.I couldn't finish watching it because it was clashing with my fond memories of it.
0,Nice Design but cheap,I grew up with these scope caps. Always loved them. I just bought the 02A for a Trijicon 1-4x24 worn by a Wilson AR15 in 6.8. On the first day of use the open cap snagged on pants and the lid broke off.
0,THIS SHARK HAS NO BITE,"In retrospect, it's more than likely that JAWS should not have had any sequels. The three followups pale in comparison and offered nothing new. Without Steven Spielberg, Richard Dreyfuss or Robert Shaw, this second JAWS is lacklusterly directed by Jeannot Szwarc, a Frenchman who should stick with low key films like his SOMEWHERE IN TIME or his stints on the NIGHT GALLERY tv series. His pace is so languid, there is little suspense generated. It doesn't help that too much time is focused on a bunch of teenagers who are merely whiny and plot devices. Roy Scheider tries gamely to recreate the passion of his original role, but even he seems tired and bored with the whole thing. Even John Williams score is uninspired and redundant. If you like shark attack movies, you may be able to tolerate this...just don't think it's as good as JAWS."
0,Wish I could return it,Rushed right out and bought it the first day because I love Alan's stuff. I wish I could return it!!!!!! Nothing country on here. It's all mellow enough pop you could use it to help you go to sleep. I like Trace Adkins new album Dangerous man a LOT more than this new one from Alan. Sorry Alan - we've all gone country - you should come back!
0,not the real scrabble,"This was a mistake. I thought I was buying regular scrabble with the rotating board, which my daughter has always wanted. I have a set like this and she always comments about how nice it is when we play. When she opened it to play, she found it was some other version of the game and was very disappointed. Now she must go through the hassle of returning it by January 31 to get the delux real scrabble. I will never make a purchase like this online again.Claire Quaglieri"
0,Worthless,"I ordered this cord less than two weeks ago to replace one that had been on our key system for over 10 years. Initially, it was good, but in less than one week it was already out of shape and please know that it is not used for moving around - only to pick up and answer the phone while sitting at my desk. Today it is completely stretched out and I am having to order a different one. I am going to buy the one that is a few dollars more, hoping for far better results. To the point: this was one time that I got exactly what I paid for."
1,Glad I got it,"This little thing holds my '99 Ford truck key as well as a small key for the bed topper. It's sturdy, waterproof, and holds very fast to the metal of the truck with a magnet. If you're looking to attach it to a plastic/fiberglass/polymer bumper it comes with a small metal plate that you can adhere to the car and then attach the case to. I've had it for 5 months, driven 5000 miles up mountain, over deserts, through fields and it hasn't so much as shifted an inch nor popped open. Even if it did pop open a little, the keys are held in place by a elastic band. I've used it twice to get into the truck when I've misplaced my key and I can imagine it'll come in handy if I ever need to leave the truck someplace for a friend to pick up."
0,Finalizing and editing,"We have this camera at our work site. It takes fairly good pictures/video. The biggest complaint I have is the same as others here: Finalizing a disc is very unclear, and the format used in VR mode is not very user friendly.However, thanks to the interwebs, I will tell you how to do these; seeing as Canon can't.To finalize a DVD, you need to be in ""Play"" mode and the Camera must be PLUGGED in to an electrical outlet. (Very lame IMHO)If you want to be able to use your videos, shoot in video mode, not VR. Yes this limits your option to edit the video on your camera, but it makes the discs compatible and easily finalized into a format readable by your DVD player/computer."
1,Laugh out loud fun,"I selected Lucy Sullivan for our bookclub this month since the reviews said ""Bridget Jones meets Sex in the City"". It sounded like fun! Keyes delivered with a funny, sad, and cute story about the 20-something lifestyle. Lucy is a single working girl adventuring through a boring job, happy hours, dating, and girlfriends. Many of her adventures hit close to home, though at times I wanted to shake her a bit to wake up and smell the coffee. This book is a great airplane, beach, or pure entertaining read. Don't let the pages fool you -- the book is a very quick read."
0,Expensive and they rip,"I'm not a fan of these gloves. The arrive in the box all stuck together and when you try to open them, so that you can put you hand in them, they rip! I think out of 100 of them I've ripped like 10 of them just trying to open them up. Also they don't last any longer than any other normal gloves that do not try to sell you on being tough. Don't waste your money and just get the regular gloves."
1,good quality cane,"We thought that it would be lighter for a halloween costume, but no... it is an actual walking stick so it has some weight to it."
0,10 Steps Back,"I have purchased every CD,VHS and DVD of Raul and The Mavericks Plus Los Super Seven.Raul puts on a tremendous live performance.Having has seen him 6 times.But he has taken 10 steps back in this recent cd.Most of the songs have no feel or soul.If his new band members really cared about Raul,they would have voiced their opinion and STOPPED this CD from ever being made.Have to say this the first time I had ever thrown away a CD.Raul's version of most of the songs on this cd make me feel like I am having 32 teeth drilled at the same time without novacaine.Raul,PLEASE call Robert,Paul,Eddie and Jerry Dale,make up and then make a New Mavericks CD.Please don't become Estaban or a Washed up Pat Boone trying to make music/covers that just don't suit you.As a fan of yours for 16 years,PLEASE make a change and let me be a fan for year 17.Thanks!!!"
1,Extremely funny but loses it's fun after a week,"I found this cd extremly funny but only when i listened with friends. I never laughed at it when listening on my own. It gets boring after a week as you've heard the tracks too many times. Still, the first week of it is awesome and worth it!!!"
0,"happy days, 1960's",this is what is bad about these low cost oldies collections. you think your getting a good deal on great memories as you remember them. instead your getting a rerecorded bad recording of maybe one original member. i hate when this happens.
0,Where's the Color,"As a long fan of Mister Miracle comics and a fellow artist who loves the work of Jack Kirby, I find this book as an insult to a great legacy. I didn't know how important color would of meant to keeping the feel and creative mastery that only a Kirby superhero was capable of.I don't buy the idea that the publisher of this book found it a problem to reproduce the original color. Even I have some of the original Mister Miracle comics and have created PDF files creating several of them and the color is just fine.If you are a true Mister Miracle fan or comic book collector of any sort please be advised to skip this one and wait for a color version. Black and white takes away the true feel and excitement that I remember while reading a Mister Miracle comic at an early age.Stay away."
1,The BEST for damaged hair!,This product is the best I have ever found. I recommend it to all my family and friends. I have thin hair that damages easily and looks like straw even with other conditioners. THIS product is amazing. I take a small amount (less than the size of a dime) and work it into ALL my hair and LEAVE IT IN. My daughter has long hair and just works it into the ends. I cannot say enough about this amazing product. My hair is shiny and healthy!
0,Looks and feels like a high school video production,"Could not get past the ""feel"" of the movie being like someone took it on their cheap home video camera and got their friends to act on it. Way below what is considered a ""B"" movie."
0,No good,I recently bought this product and I have not seen any change at all. I am very disappointed. It costs a lot of money and it doesnt do anything!!!!!
0,Totally Disappointing Is My Feeling on This Book,"I was so disappointed with this book that I could only read half of it. Maybe I was expecting something similar to his other books but, whatever the reason, I could not finish it. This book seemed like something along the line of what John Saul would write but only not as good."
1,A Truly Fascinating Book,"After the Magnifecent Seven's wonderful performance at the '96 Olympic Games, I decided to read this book to find out more about these talented young women. I thought it was terrific! There are biographies of each of the seven members along with really cool pictures. This book was awesome. These seven are really magnificint and it shows!"
0,The Stalker,"This movie is the ""R"" rated virsion of ""The Seduction Of Maxine"". They cut 90% of the sex scenes out witch makes this worthless to buy. Give us the real version of the movie!"
0,Did not work for me,"My windows 7 computer is not able to run this as the screen color is way off. So, do not buy it for a new computer to play."
0,Doesn't grow hair,This doesn't regrow hair at all. But it is a nice shampoo and makes your hair feel thicker.
1,Good quality; great value,"For $13.50 from Amazon, you can't beat this item. It's made almost entirely of plastic, but it's plenty sturdy to keep a toddler from breaking through it.You should be aware that this is designed to attach to a *flat* wood or drywall surface on both sides. (If drywall, I'd highly recommend you pick up some anchors, since this doesn't come with any.) I managed to attach it to our metal stair railing by securing a 1x3 to a post with U-bolts and screwing the brackets into the 1x3.It is not the easiest to latch or unlatch, so I would not necessarily recommend it for a high-traffic area."
0,Bad bad sound!,"The staging is okay, but the sound is ABSOLUTELY terrible.Just can't understand they actually are selling this product!"
1,Good Old Time Collection,"I don't have to go alot into detail, because most of you have seen all three holiday specials. What I will say is that this collection contains three seperate DVDs in a single collection. What I mean there are three individually cased DVDs in a gift box. Another thing I love about this collection is that it covers the three major winter holidays, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. And all of this for less than 10 dollars a DVD, now you can't beat that. If you are looking for a holiday collection for your child this is a great one"
0,Reads Like a Sociology Book,"I really didn't care for this book for what it was supposed to be: a look at modern Paganism. Too much of the time, I felt like I was sitting in an especially dry sociology class, learning about strange and exotic people who aren't in very close contact with reality. I felt she made Pagans look a little stranger than we really are... but maybe the Pagans I know aren't quite as ""exotic.""The scope of the book is broad, and persons interested in an overview of Paganism will surely get an education. Perhaps the christian fundamentalists could read this and see that they have nothing to fear. If you *really* want an overview of ""American Pagans today,"" save yourself the money and surf the 'Net instead."
0,Beware....,This a multipack of different door lock clips that are supposed to be applicable to the tailgate handle of a 2007 GMC Sierra. This isn't entirely untrue but isn't really the case either. After 15 minutes of fooling around with three or four of the clips I finally managed to get one of them to work. My suggestion is to go to the dealership and pay for the GMC replacement.
0,Beware this TV is Made In Mexico!,I bought this hunk of junk TV five months ago as a Christmas present to my mom. Yesterday it conked out.Now I have to go thru the hassle of getting it fixed all because Panasonic wants to boost profits by having it's TV's assembled in Mexico. They only have to pay workers 50 cents an hour there....you get what you pay for. I'll never buy anything with Panasonico's name on it again.
0,Very disappointed,what can I say -Lousy focus; almost no depth of fieldpoor software; works ok on w2000 but not on xppointless cradle; nice idea but it proves to be useless on xp- wish I had bought another make
1,Susan Tedeschi blues singer,Susan Tedeschi and Bonnie Riatt are my favorite female blues singers. On this cd Susan really belts it out with unbelievable feeling. She has been described as a cross between Bonnie Riatt and Janis Joplin. Fantastic!
0,Another media scare tactic!,"Morgan spurlock has super sized his wallet with your fears.Anyone who ignores common sense and shovels in fried meal after fried meal deserves what ever happens to him, to include liver failure!I dont care where you get your food, if you eat grease soaked food day after day, anyone with half a brain is gonna know it's eventualy take its toll on you.Dont blame mcdonals, blame bad choices.If im going to take health advice from someone,a film maker would not be anywhere near my first choice.This film is nothing more than self righteous crusade ( Me and my vegetarian girlfriend are good..the rest of you suck)Show me a Vegitarian boxing champion or a vegetarian ultimate fighting champion!if morgan spurlock ever wins a body building competition or gets his MD in nutrition, I might listen to what he has to say...until then, he is a joke, praying on a lot of peoples insecurities!Eat less, Exercise more, Make good Choices...the rest will follow!"
1,Excellent Vacuum!,"This is the best canister vacuum I have ever used/owned. It is easy to use, powerful, and has very low emissions. It is a true high efficiency vacuum. The bag, Hoover S, is easy to change.I do have one quibble that keeps it from 5 stars. It is NOISY. If it were quieter, it would be the equal of the expensive European vacuums, like miele, and nilfisk."
0,Fodor's German For Traveloers (Phrase Book) 3rd Edition,CDs were included with the 2nd edition. Why are they missing from the 3rd edition? They are a vital part of learning the phrases!
0,Don't Buy this item,I have purchased a lot of heated mattress pads - a luxury I learned from my mother. I have NEVER paid $120.00 for one - and NEVER had one made with such cheap materials!! The wiring is so stiff leading to the controls they won't stay put unless left on the floor. The fabric is throw-away fabric - NOT like a regular fluffy mattress pad that I am accustomed to in even less expensive pads. This thing is going back to Macy's.
1,nice..,"I bought this a couple of weeks ago after going through the reviews here and I am very pleased with my purchase. These stands are reasonably priced and easy to assemble. If you'd like to know how a good speaker stand could impact how one listens to music, you'll probably wanna tinker with the height of the stands till its at the optimum ear level. At less than $30 a pair, this is a bargain!Update -Its more than 6 years since purchase, and I've upgraded my Home Theater system, but I haven't got rid of these. They are still great, and almost like new."
1,Soothing return to the past!,"If you grew up in a place where the sounds of frogs lulled you to sleep at night, this is the CD for you! Very relaxing after a long day."
0,a huge mistake,"This what happens when you screw around with pro-tools and forget fix the mistakes. The guitar solo at the end of ""Fearless"" is so bad and phoned in, it's unbelievable. The keyboard playing is a joke throughout the whole CD, the guitar playing is brutally awful and lackluster, and the bass player sounds like he's playing two big rubber bands. Plus, if it's not the too many momentum-killing changes, then it's the lack of originality. No punch or intensity to be found on the whole damn disc. Oh, and let's not forget the singer, who sounds like he's singing through a tin can. Total Bull."
0,This thing sucks!,My husband and I just brought this DVD player home this evening. It played one movie just fine. I even thought...how great for so cheap. I put in the next movie and after I finished watching the previews and started the movie it started making this awful noise. The thing can't be turned off. I had to unplug it to get it to power off. I even re-started it and it did the very same thing. It goes back tomorrow! Don't waste your money!
1,The dog loves it.,"I like it and so does my dog. She sees me get the towel, shampoo and the brush she runs to the side of the tub where she gets cleaned up.Great shampoo!@"
1,Lots of good ideas on how to celebrate the Sabbats,"I amin the process of buying all of the books mentioned in a book called The Well Read Witch. This book is one of the books listed as a must-read for Witches. I wholeheartedly agree with that and list the reasons why this is such a good book in my review.This book is full of lots of ideas on how to celebrate each Sabbat. I can't imagine someone not finding at least one idea they like a lot for each Sabbat!I like the way she includes recepes in most of her books! My coven uses this book as a starting point in planning our Sabbat rituals!As always, her writing style is readable and enjoyable. Edain McCoy is a very reassuring writer for a new Witch to read who might still have some lingering fears or misconceptions about The Craft."
1,Excellent Box Set,This is the great and excellent musical Fleetwood Mac's chain. Buy it or die!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A Classic
0,It doesn't have a write protect switch!,"Another reviewer says this model has a write protect switch. Where the write protect switch is on his model, mine just has a small hole. I suspect that maybe some early models had a write protect switch, but the one I got today definitely does not. (Lexar never claims this model has a write protect switch).The small whole exposes the circuit board, allowing dust, pocket lint, liquid, etc., inside. (At least in principal....) This is very annoying...I'd really like to have a write protect switch, and bought this because I thought that it had one.Otherwise it's nice so far. I echo other reviewers' that the clip on the cover seems superfulous. The drive is also a little large to be on a keychain. It is nice that the keychain is attached to the base of the drive though. This means you can't easily disconnect it from your keychain, but also means that it will be harder to lose."
0,Piece of junk,"Utterly worthless. The plunger does not force meat through the tube stuffer no matter how hard it is forced down; rather, it squishes the liquid out of the meat and allows meat to slide around the edges of the plunger."
1,Nice!!!,"Good image quality, not setup necesary, maybe tends to be a litle bit warm. Has instructions for adjusment external and internal (I do not want to open this!!. But the component quality is excellent"
1,Fantastic classic,"Highly recommended platform game. A gem on the original PlayStation.Using 2D ""sprite"" characters amidst a 3D background, Klonoa avoids a dated look other games of that console generation suffer. It still looks fantastic, and plays great.The controls in this game manages to (outside the d-pad to move) only use two buttons, but you're never left feeling as if you're missing out on anything. If you like platform games, Klonoa is a blast, and the story is memorable."
0,Housekeeping - Marilynne Robinson's first novel,"This strange novel concerns two young girls, Ruth and Lucille orphaned by the death of their mother and then their grandmother. Eventually their aunt, Sylvie, moves in to provide adult presence in the household. Sylvie is a wanderer who ""sleeps with her shoes under her pillow"" and her head at the other end of the bed. She allows the girls to be truants. While Lucille begins to realize she needs to move away from Sylvia and finds a new home with a teacher, Ruth is more influenced by her Aunt Sylvie. Her life becomes more disorganized as she and Sylvie begin traveling first locally and then further away. This is a haunting tale."
0,A sad display of Ringo's writing skill,"It is poorly executed, very disturbing. I'm not surprised the author had to be talked into publishing it. It reads more like a private exorcism of personal demons than something intended for public consumption. The sex is disturbing, the rape was totally useless in advancing the plot.If Ringo needs to work out his sexual kinks then he needs to go see a shrink. This book is trash, buy it at a used book store."
1,The BEST of the best,"You will have no regrets buying this CD.Carrie is beautiful and her voice is amazing.Stand out songs are Wasted, Some Hearts and I ain't in Checotah Anymore.A perfect CD !"
0,Bad Description- doesn't work with zire 71,"Should have looked at the reviews. It doesn't work with my Zire71, and since I opened it, I'm stuck. Palm's marketing and descriptions of addons are a mess, and this is a prime example. You can't tell what works with what, because information is incomplete or conflicting. I stuck with Palm for my third pda, but I'm beginning to wonder if that was a good decision."
1,Wonderful slim lightweight watch!,"Love this beautiful watch! It's the lightest weight so you can hardly feel it on. Its silhouette is very thin so it doesn't get caught on anything. It's very well made, keeps perfect time, and is beautiful with its real mother-of-pearl dial!! You will love this watch!"
1,Pretty great and helpful,"I only gave it four stars because it is mainly geared towards people living in the city without any yard. I have a small yard and could use some more advice on how to utilize it properly. However, the book is fantastic in it's detailing of how to do it all: make compost, fix your soil, pick your plants, plant your plants...Very helpful and informative to the new gardener. I just hope I can pull it all together and make it work."
0,Beyond God awfull,"To call this film God-awful is an understatement. The story was terrible. The ""acting"" was amateurish. The special effects (if you want to call them that), were very, very low budget.I downloaded this mess to my Tivo for 99 cents, and it was still overpriced. I gave up watching it after about fifteen minutes."
1,We're All Mummies,"Mark E. Smith knows how to cover a song. In fact, he does so on most Fall albums. Levitate features a couple of cover songs including the haunting ""I'm a Mummy"". I'd go so far as to say the rest of the material on this album is superfluous and pales like an uninvited geist next to this marvelous gem of a remake. Throwaway song? I think not! Wrap this version in gauze, put its guts in canopic jars, and treasure it forever. Buy the album for ""I'm a Mummy"" alone. The only thing that could make this album better would be if every song were ""I'm a Mummy"". For this lack for foresight, I'll have to dock the album a star."
0,Will Never Buy Pampers Again,"I have to believe we got a defective lot, but the right hand side adhesive tab tears itself free on about 2 out of 3 diapers that we put on our newborn--after the diaper is on the baby and her clothes are buttoned up. We have resorted to medical tape to hold the diapers together. This is our 3rd child, so we're pretty sure we aren't trying to put them on too tight."
1,Programming ASP.NET (O'Reilly Windows),"This book is very helpful for beginners. There are lot of examples in both VB and C# and builds good understanding about ASP.NET , so I would rank as four stars."
0,"Is this a ""contract"" book? It's awful -- NOT RECOMMENDED","I'm a real Patricia Cornwell fan, and I opened ""Hornet's Nest"" with great expectations -- expecting more of Kay Scarpatta.No Kay? That was disappointment number one.Who are these people? Flat, improbable, cut from cardboard and dropped into the word processor with the hope that a plot will gel and a story emerge.It never did.I kept reading, waiting for the magic, for the point where the book would take off. It never did, and the end was as laboured as the beginning.This one's a dog -- I'm looking forward to more of KS, but please spare me the Charlotte Police Dept."
1,Best source of information on GPS,One of the students in my lecture came up to me and said he had studied this book all summer to learn about GPS. He found it to be very helpful to him and he said it was the best source of information on GPS he had come across.
0,more smelly than squirmy,I took it to a bachelorette party. I seemed more a prop than a sex toy because it had that silly crank hanging from it and really doesn't appear to squirm much. It got alot of laughs.
0,Artificial flavor? Why?!?,"Besides artificial vanilla Cadbury chocolate often contains artificial flavor, which, to me leaves an odd aftertaste.Artificial flavor is ""flavor"" created in a lab and tested on lab rats to keep them eating. Why does it need to be added to chocolate!?!?Poor disingenuous product as far as I see it"
1,New Dungeons and Dragons for New Players,This is a great refrence for the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition Game. Its layout is easy to follow for new Dungeon Masters and should be an easy conversion for experienced Dungeon Masters.
1,sweet java,THIS IS A GREAT TASTING AND EASY TO USE PRODUCT. WE LOVE MCDONALD'S ICED COFFEE. THIS IS JUST AS GOOD AND WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. CAN'T WAIT TO RE-ORDER AND TRY OTHER FLAVORS.........
1,NOT just a children's book!,"JK Rowling has a wonderful imagination. She brings you into the story immediately and you're there with Harry, enjoying all the adventures. I've read it twice, so far, and I won't loan my copy out."
0,Scratcy and unable to hear,I received the cassettes which I am unable to listen to because they are scratchy.
0,.........I Found Myself Thinking Why I Bought This Book.,"I am Surprised for two things with this book.1)Title reads power of thinking without thinking which is not at all congruent with its content.2)What made this book a Bestseller ?I felt Like sleeping while reading this book.So do youself a favour.Buy this book only if you have insomnia, if not then look for something else."
1,Entertaining,"This is not another GODFATHER. It's an entertaining romantic comedy among Mafiosi. Typical is the exchange between the wife and the husband. The wife remarks that she has saved much money from the pay for murdering five people over the last two (?) years. ""That many?"" the husband asks disapprovingly, and she answers defensively: ""It's not a whole lot, considering the total population"". It's that kind of humor."
0,This is the worst textbook I have ever seen.,I just read the reviews and I can not understand why some people have given the book more than a single star let alone like it. It is by far the worst textbook I have ever used. I am baffled that it made it to print. I can only guess that the people who did like it must already know stat mech and have no appreciation for the omissions that make the book completely ineffective for learning. I agree with every negative comment made about this book. It is horrific.
1,"Great Book, Depressing Pictures","The text itself is funny and frank and really gets down to business. It will tell you everything about everything. It's an overall excellent reference book and would recommend that everyone have a copy to refer to whenever necessary. However, they used models for the pictures throughout the book. You feel like you don't deserve to have this wonderful sex unless you first are 5'10"" tall and weigh 105 pounds, which is bizarre since it's wrote by two women. You'd think they'd get some realistic models, both male and female. Everyone who's taken a look at the book (male and female) has made similar comments. It's depressing."
0,Why is this book so highly rated?,"I don't know why this book was on the best sellers list for so long. I normally love to read and always finish my books but I just can't finish this one. I can't relate to her at all and wonder if anyone who has a somewhat normal life with responsibilities such as a husband, kids, career, housework, bills, aging parents, etc. relates? I got so tired of her trials with meditation, prayer, and travels...she doesn't know what REAL problems are."
1,What's not to like?,"I suppose if you're not a Cyndi fan this CD may not appeal to you. But for my money, it's one of the more creative, unique entries in the pop Christmas genre. I especially enjoy holiday CDs (like this one) that have songs other than the usual standards you hear over and over again.Of course, there are a couple of covers, like ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" and ""Silent Night."" But mostly you'll get to enjoy some new sounds that only the Cyndi could make work.Highly recommended for any Cyndi fan, or any pop fan who wants something off the beaten path to jam to during holiday festivities."
0,Kid's Acoustic Toy Guitar,"My grandson loved the guitar, but sadly it broke the first day. Not worth the money for this toy. The glue broke at the neck where it connects to the body of the guitar. His dad is going to glue it back and it will probably be better than new."
1,Works Good,I received this Glove months ago and it has not shown any signs of wear at all. It fits great and i cant bowl without it any more. I feel naked without it. I recomend this to any seriouse bowler.
0,TINY,I thought you would be able to clip more than paper with these but they are tiny. I think I might try them in my car with a blanket for my baby to block the sun in her eyes since all the baby shades SUCK.
1,"Worked great for a year and a half, but eventually the probe stopped reading the right temperture",The headline says it all. I bought a bunch of these from [...] a few years ago. We used them once a week and they work well. Only problem is that the probe no longer reads the right temperature. It is also annoying that replacement probes are $[...]/each. It would be nice if Amazon sold a two pack of the replacement probes for $12 w/Amazon prime shipping. That would be fair.
1,Animal Farm,"Animal Farm grabbed me and pulled me into the story right away. Already at the beginning you decided which animals you liked and which you had something against. When laws began mysteriously changing, and things started to become unfair, that's when you knew something was wrong. I would definitely recommend anyone too read it, because anyone who reads it will see the story differently from other people, so everyone can enjoy it. It&#65533;s very well written, and I will definately read it again when I get older, especially since I live on a farm."
1,Supernatural,"With the flood of supernatural books on the market right now its hard to find one that really stands out. I enjoyed ""Nightlife"" so much I was compelled to write my first amazon review. This book achieves a balance of all the things I like in a book-memorable characters, clever dialogue full of sarcasm, action, mystery, suspense and just a hint of romance (smut free thankfully). All this and a twist that's unique to any book I remember reading.The author's website says a sequel is coming next year but I don't think I can wait that long. I want to know what happens to Cal and Niko now!"
1,Nice DVD set,"I purchased this dvd set and was really surprised how nice it was.I would recommend this dvd set to anyone,especially if your a walking tall fan."
0,first spaceship on venus,"the movie is a great movie, but this version was not good. the vocals start talking 5 seconds before there lips move. this movie was not meant for wide screen. alot of it was caught off on top & bottom. thank you! JESUS LOVES YOU!"
1,Electric Fence Tester,I HAVE THREE OF THE DARE TESTERS THAT I KEEP AT SEPARATE LOCATIONS. ALL WORK FLAWLESSLY. BOUGHT THE FIRST ONE MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO.
1,A Definite Must Read!,I just bought this book yesterday and if I didn't have a young child I would have kept reading it until I couldn't read no more. It is so hard to put down. What a way of looking at what comes after death. Remarkable!
0,........,"Well I'm not sure where to start so I'm going to cut to the chase. The singer can't sing. The drummer is ok. Guitar riffs are so-so. The lyrics aren't very good either. There false stop is overused. Happens in every song from what I remember. I only listened to this once or twice. I Only Want You is the only good song on this cd. I felt that on most of this album the band was going for catchy driving riffs but since they aren't very good, I heard gargled guitars with the same drum beat. Avoid this please. If you want catchy rythms with great lyrics, try Hot Water Music."
1,A must-read for anyone having anything to do with children!,"This book is not just for parents. It should also be read by teachers, principals, school administrators, counselors, Sunday school teachers , and grandparents - anyone who spends time with our children. They are our future and it is important to the future of our children that we use and teach the ""Forward Focus"" and ""Positive Messaging"" techniques prescribed in this book. Our children, ourselves, and our society can only benefit from it and becuase of it we may someday live in a world full of positivity and possibility."
0,Not true signs,I bought this for my daughter hoping to give her books with her first language in it (ASL). I was very disappointed with this book. The signs are not any where near to what ASL signs are. It's an insult I think to call it baby sign when it isn't even signing.
0,Not very useful information,"I purchased ""The Wonder of Probiotics"" at the same time as this book. The Wonder of Probiotics contains plain and simple valuable information on how to use probiotics to improve your health. I found this book very boring and not containing useful information on how to incorporate probiotics into your life. Don't waste your money."
1,An awesome drummer = Ron Wilson,I have had the pleasure of witnessing this first hand since I am Ron Wilson's daughter. Thanks for the excellent reviews. If you want to hear some of the best drumming in the world... get this cd!
1,Toxic Bass,"This is a classic of the bass genre by DJ Billy E. A must have for anyone into bass music, house, or hot mix."
0,Not durable,"I really like the regular Fantom vacuums so I decided to buy this handheld to see if worked any better than my Dirtdevil. It actually worked better but it broke after 4 months. Completely dead. I called Fantom and asked what the return policy is and it was only good for 90 days. Therefore, I'm still using my Dirtdevil."
1,Absolutely great,"This book has something for everyone -- for people in crisis, it offers warmth and guidance and understanding. For the average reader, it suggests ways to help our friends who are grieving or worrying or struggling, and words of wisdom to inspire us. For searchers who struggle with their faith, this book is a blessing. It is so clearly written, so gently spiritual, that it provides comfort to the mind.Not only is this a wonderful book about faith and values, but it is also a wonderful book about leadership, written by an excellent role model. I read it fast, then slowed down and read it again. Now I open it in the mornings whenever I want a little spirituality.Living Faith is restful and exciting. I strongly recommend you buy it."
1,Cats Love It!,"All four cats LOVE these springs. This is a great toy for the cats to play with by themselves. They just love seeing them roll on the floor. All of our cats love to ""launch"" these into the air and then run full speed to catch them."
0,not good,"sorry, but I think is not good the envelope because the glue not seal well, I have to get another box with another system to close the envelope, may be the box you send me, whith the envelopes Quality Park # 10, Rediseal was too old and the glue in bad conditions to seal"
1,Absolutely AWESOME!...,"We were wary at first because so many reviews for all portable DVD players talk about skipping and needing to return the product. We're glad we found a winner. ... it has been worth every penny! Every month we've been commuting up and down California with a 1 and 3 year old in the backseat. Anyone who has a small child would appreciate knowing a 3 year old can be occupied well for 9 hours in a SUV. It's simple enough for my son to work the ""mouse"" to select his movies and play his Blues Clues and Thomas the Tank Engine games. The sound quality is great and the battery life is really long compared to others too (5+ vs 3 hours)."
0,Gave up on this book,"I really tried, but at one-third through I quit. I hated the characters. There wasn't a sympathetic one in the bunch. Plus, nothing happened. I have no idea who the hostile witness turned out to be because at one-third of the way into the book there was still no legal thriller. In fact, there was no legal or thriller. Nothing had happened. Shallow nasty characters and no plot. Don't know if it got better. Don't care. I must not have read the same book as all those who gave it 5 stars. I'm sticking with one star."
0,Flimsy,"While this product is a perfect size for storing a cake, it is not good quality. The base of the cake keeper began cracking after only a few uses. The crack quickly grew larger, and I had to throw it out. Don't waste your money."
0,Thirty Years Too Late,"This forgettable modern tale of a woman who wanders away from home looking for ""she doesn't know what"" and ending with her rather laughable attempt to bond with the earth by lying on it, uncomfortably, overnight, would have seemed more relevant and maybe even more believable, 30 years ago. The heroine is much too gentle and satisfied a character to be seeking her ""enlightenment."""
0,Not in love with these.,"I ordered these a couple of months ago, but my patio is finally installed so I just put them out last week. In two of the lamps, the batteries will not hold a charge at all. In the rest of them, so far they are only holding about a three hour charge after dark. I suspect that the batteries that are used in these are not the best. I may buy some new nicd batteries and test to see if they work better. I suspect that buying new batteries for all of the lamps may cost more than the lamps. The lamps themselves are very attractive when they are not in the dark."
1,Italy Metal Gods,These guys are awsome the talent that come's from this band is pretty well out mached in the genre.
0,Disappointed,"After using Taxcut Deluxe software for 4 years, I was disappointed with the current 2004 version. The software showed an Error message for the Charitable Worksheet, simply because you are expected to wait until February to download an update! It must be corrected before filing. So, I did more research and ended using TurboTax online free e-filing for my federal return and I paid the $19.95 fee to e-file my state return; which is the method I plan to use next year. No more Taxcut software expense for me."
1,great coloring book and story!,"My daughter,Rachel,loves this book, and it is even more special because it is by her great-Uncle Bill!"
0,NOT SO GOOD,"Too predictable -- just think as a screenwriter composing a product for pre-pubescent teenagers who groove an geeky hi-tech explanations but haven't a clue about plot development and you'll understand how flawed this otherwise good film really is.The first indication is Sam's initial missed opportunity to off Leo the Touch -- had he been done in, the script would have had the chance to become a great caper, but, alas..."

0,in good shape? don't bother.,"I really enjoy yoga and am in quite good shape and I was extremely disappointed in this video. It had no effect on my abs. I felt no burn. I could have done this while asleep. Bottom line: if you can see your feet, don't bother with this tape."
0,Doesn't work with kitchen faucet,I live in an apartment and was hoping to use this to water my indoor plants and small kitchen garden while on holiday but the timer doesn't fit the kitchen faucet. I can't figure out how to get it working :( I guess I need a connector of some sort and might change the rating once I get it working but I was really disappointed.
1,True to the Original Nintendo Spirit!,"This game is GREAT! It reminds me of Super Mario 3 -- I loved that game when it first came out! This DS game is highly similar in the way the levels are set up, but there are a few more options (e.g. you can bounce off walls, new characters, etc.).I think one of the reasons I love this game so much is because it's been years since I played Super Mario 3, and this DS version really reminds me of that -- I'm an adult, and I'm really enjoying this."
0,To short for 200W,To short for the 200W otherwise it makes a great storage case. Should have been told this.
1,Lauryn Hill is the undisputed Queen of Hip-Hop!!!,Lauryn sings with a maturity and depth that belie her years. Her rhythms and lyrics connect instantly with both the young and old. She has deeply touched the lives of young women struggling to find their voice and self-esteem. Her music is fun and provocative. Go Lauryn!
0,"Real life is, apparently, a formulaic Hollywood movie",Everyone is great. People are great. And predictable. What a beautiful predictable Real-Life story. This is NOT a story adapted and over-sentimentalized by a Hollywood hack. Wonderful.
0,Won't survive the long haul,"I bought this coffee maker mostly because of the timer feature. I have to say that worked just fine. While the coffee maker worked, we really had no complaints. We brew one pot of coffee every morning. However, one night while setting the timer, my husband forgot to dump the leftover coffee out from the previous morning so he got up to an overflowing pot. We only had the coffee maker for about a month and after the overflow it will not work at all. I know this is our fault, but I do expect a coffee maker to be more durable than that. Just be aware that if you (or your spouse) is the forgetful type, you might want to consider a different coffee maker because this one will not stand up to your memory lapses."
0,Flimsy construction and can be opened in < 2 seconds,"I purchased one of these units some time ago. After about 4 weeks the electric servo mechanism that opens the internal latch failed to operate, leaving the latch stuck in the closed position and preventing me from using even the key override. Permanently stuck in a closed and locked state. I had to pry the safe door open with screwdriver to recover my firearm (a process that took, amazingly, 45 seconds with a common screwdriver - very soft steel).Also, these safes (at least the model I had) can be opened in under 2 seconds without a key or combo. Make sure you mount them securely so they don't fall and like, hit the ground or anything..."
0,Stick with Crayola,"I bought these for my almost-2 year old son, as we take crayons and a drawing pad with us whenever we go to restaurants. I have soem crayola crayons, which are great, but the cardboard box they come in gets ripped easily, and then the crayons start getting lost. I bought these because they come in a travel case, which I thought would help with the lost crayons issue.Pros would be: good color selection, nice and chunky for small hands.Cons vastly outweigh the pros, and are that the colours are very weak, some barely show up on paper at all (orange, light blue for example) and the so-called ""travel case"" is made of the flimsiest plastic imaginable, more like the stuff that cheap blister packs are made of. I don't expect the ""travel case"" will last any longer than the crayola cardboard.This was a waste of money, and I would recommend buying Crayola crayons, and putting them in a sturdy tin case instead."
1,Just plain cute +8,"As I was channel-surfing one day, I happened upon a channel that had several little kids all sitting around a table being fed by the Mommy. I was curious what this was and besides, these kids were so cute, I just had to check it out. Come to find out, this would become one of my favorite programs on 'TLC'. ""Jon and Kate Plus 8"" is a straight-forward, stress-relieving, entertaining show, with six of the cutest kids on TV, and with a pair of older twin sisters that are having their own growing pains. I am hoping this show will continue for years to come. If you love little kids, you will like this video."
1,Great way to view past seasons,My wife and I enjoyed catching up on this amazing show. It was easy to connect and pleasant to watch.
1,Delightful story that shares something in common with us all,A pleasant read that pokes fun of all those fatherly qualities we can all find in our own dads.I will definitely have this around for my father when I get married!!!
1,Super God Glorifying Music,I found this video to be encouraging and edifying. The words and music are such that I want them part of my worship experience weekly. They deal with the sovereignty of God and the need of man scripturely. What a glorious experience!
1,"Man O man, they sure have surprised me!","First of all I'd like to point out that the album is a GREAT one, Flickerstick can ROCK! I got to know the band on VH1's ""Bands on the run"" and i wasn't that taken with them or their songs (except for ""smile"", which i loved from the begining) but after listening to their album dubbed ""Welcoming Home The Astronauts"" I became aware of how talented the members really are and understood why they won VH1's little survivor game for bands.I recommend you people take the time and listen to this fantastic album, enjoy!"
0,COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"where do i begin? it's boring, the dialogue is lame, the voice overs are beyond the normal cheesiness of a film like this, the plot circles around without ever going anywhere, and the ""martial arts"" are merely cheap theatrics. the only thing about this movie that could possibly make it even halfway decent are the zombies, but they're not quite enough to make this peice of crap redeemable.actually, the most entertaining parts of this movie are those where the main female character (a weak whining idiot) gets knocked over the head by the male characters"
1,Great Deal!,"Product works just wonderfully, I feel like this was well worth the price. 50 sheets of sea weed will last me for quite a long time, even though I have sushi almost once a week."
0,horrrible,"i dont think that these bands could have done a worse job covering these songs. It is the worst thing i have ever heard, I am not saying that they are not talented bands but this is a horrible cd."
1,Bulgarian tracks,"Unlike modern productions, these recordings are not at all overproduced, maybe from the '50s. Very straightforward, rather village bands: brass, nice singing. Good clarinet and trumpet solos, wonderful baritones thundering along behind. Get this back in stock and I'll buy a bunch for my friends too."
1,djcw's review,The author's first book on customer service driven a approaches to running a successful gaming enterprise.
1,Great additoion to SS series,"These videos are a great addition to my SS series. Everything that we have read about, they have covered in the videos."
0,A Tale of Self-Heroism,"When I went to purchase the book at a Karachi bookshop there was an amusing debate going on between some of the shop staff and customers on whether the book was better suited for the fiction shelves as opposed to its assigned place in the non-fiction section.I suggest to all die-hard Musharraf fans, please ease off. Most of you live in the US, Canada or elsewhere. Try living in Pakistan under this self-heroic miltary dictator who 'can do no wrong' and you might quickly change your mind.To expose the blighter all you have to do is ask him one simple question : General, Where do you see yourself five years from now?The answer will of course be ""In uniform and in power in Pakistan, and god help anyone who dares oppose me""."
0,Ignores alternative methods of recovery,"This book focuses exclusively on achieving sobriety through Alcoholics Anonymous, and it (unfortunately) ignores any other way to quit drinking. Numerous studies -- as well as common sense -- show that alcoholics/addicts are a diverse group, and that many people benefit from approaches OTHER than those that are based on the 12 steps. AA is fine for people who have a religious or spiritual bent, but other groups (like Secular Organizations for Sobriety and SMART Recovery) are appropriate for alcoholics who want to become sober without relying on a Higher Power.This book would have been much better if it had been written from a more open-minded perspective."
1,Antique Oak Capri Changing Table,We recently bought the Antique Oak Capri Changing Table - We bought the crib first - loved it - but soon found nothing matches the crib - so we decided to just go ahead and buy the changing table - granted there are better ones out there - but i wanted the babys room furniture to at least match - my husband put the changing table together in about 2 hours - great instructions - just time consuming - the overall appearance of the table is not the same exact finish as the crib - slightly off - but does have lots of room for baby stuff - and later when we do not need it as a changing table it will not look like one - can easily use it for years and years to come - great transition piece.
0,absence of presence,"reads like the transcript of a rambling interrogatory,rather than a novel. an under-employed actor/lawyer,whose chief talent seems to be bluster, blunders through a murder trial. near total lack of descriptive qualities.unusual though below average contribution to legal fiction."
1,This is soooo good,"I decided to purchase ""Quiet"" after reading the excerpt. Excellent writing along with a very compelling story. I have to agree with the other reviews this is soooo good! ""Carol"""
1,Lost Season 5 Best Yet!,"I have been a loyal LOST fan since the beginning, and I must say I think Season 5 will go down as the best season as a whole of all the seasons put together. True, there are still more seasons too go, but I really can't see how the writers & producers could do much better. I hope I am wrong, but I think Lost has hit its peak with Season 5. If you stopped watching lost for any reason this season, pre-order the DVD set for the December 2009 holiday season, and get lost again. This season (Non-Specific Basic Overall Plot Spoiler Now!!!) is very well focused and fine tuned on just a few familiar classic characters with an general emphasis on time-travel so you won't have a problem getting back into the action. Then again, you might get intellectually lost with some profound thought experiences following the drama. What a great show! That is all I will say about season 5. Go get lost again, and pre-order Lost Season 5 for a great price on amazon.com. I will..."
1,Need more DVD audio!,"In addition to the excellent conducting and performance, this is a superb recording for 7.1 or 5.1. Crisp, clean high amplitude, and not a hint of recording hiss during silence or quiet movements."
1,Becoming Better,"This book is a compliation of authentic stories that elucidates the importance of enhancing or becoming better at what you do. The book is categorized into three parts. They are dilligence, doing it right and ingenuity. In each case, he lucidly supports his propositions with pragmatic examples that motivates the reader to apply those lessson's to his or a her own personal life. It amazes me how Dr. Gwande find time to write these books as a busy general surgeon. But when he does find time to write these books, he surely do an amazing job. If you are a person wanting to enhance your aptitude at work or any part of your life, this is the book to read."
1,A Magical Music Moment,"Only a few times in my life have I experienced it. One of those moments where a song goes straight past your ears and hits your soul. I know that may sound cheesy to some of you. And normally it would sound cheesy to me as well, I don't normally talk like that. However, when I heard 88 degrees in the Shade played on 88.5 in Tampa. It was truly one of those moments. So I waited for the DJ to announce the name of the band and I got the CD. At first I won't lie, I was a little let down. But that had to be solely based on the (Non Drug Induced) magical moment I had when I first heard this band. After repeated listens it is one of my top 10 cd's. And I have thousands. So go get it!Sincerely,JohnWilliamWing@yahoo.com"
1,Kudos to the clock,This clock is perfect for those of you who like a natural worn distressed look of a Restoration Hardware vibe only at a fraction of the cost. It now hangs in my painting studio with antique drawing tables and period correct easels along with a collection of tweed newsboy and flat caps that looks like a hat rack from a 1930s labor union convention. Love it.
0,One HUGE flaw that I can't believe was missed by QC,"It's a great watch. Elegant, sturdy, polished...Except the roman numerals are wrong. Specifically, the four, which is, on the watch face, ""IIII"". Of course it should be ""IV"". I can't believe such an enormous error got past quality control!I'll be looking for a new one elsewhere."
0,POOR QUALITY -- wouldn't last one week in school!,"I purchased this product for my 1st grader. He liked the design; I liked the Jansport brand (I have had several Jansport backpacks and always was very happy). Well, the backpack was so thin I could read this review online through the material. The backpack was so lightweight that my son's water bottle could put a hole through its side. The bottom had such little support that a wet paper grocery bag would provide superior results. In summary -- I returned the product the day after it arrived at my home. I actually contacted the seller and asked him/her if this was a knock-off, and he reassured me that it was a genuine product. Although I couldn't believe him completely, the vendor was very nice and professional about returning the backpack."
0,Below Average Film,"Terribly boring movie with bad, black and white, choppy footage. The story is a bit ridiculous, blood thirsty creatures on the moon. It seemed like another zombie movie, basically. They could easily just call this movie Quarantine 3 and get away with it.It might have been better if they didn't try to make this a ""found footage"" movie. Watching bad quality, black and white, choppy scenes wasn't pleasant and it takes down my rating quite a bit."
1,cats love them!,"I have two cats. One loves the small mice and the other LOVES these springs. They like toys that are light that they can toss in the air, roll on the floor, bat and carry in thier mouth. It is such a simple cheap toy but my cats never get bored with them!! 5 star toy for the indoor cat. :)"
0,Ehhh...not so much,"I don't want to write a review that takes 15 minutes to load, but I have to say that I was highly disappointed with this book. While it has more of the feeling of books 1-4 (since book 5 is a lot more angry and emotional than the others), it breaks pattern in a not-so-good way. I don't want to spoil anything, but the fact that the only true encounters with Voldemort are in the memories of others really screws stuff up. So, while there are some interesting hook-ups and break-ups, and a death that could have been heartwrenching (I cried about the death in book 5, not this one), overall this book is pretty much...bleh."
1,a really good gba game...,"i hadn't heard much about this one before i bought it, and it pleasantly surprised me. the only possibly negative i can give to it is that you get attacked a lot in the dungeon, but that's ok at first because you want to gain levels; later you can buy potions so that you won't get attacked for a couple of minutes or so which makes this problem go away altogether. the pluses are many: the graphics and sound are good, the game design is good, the crafting is fun, the hunting is fun, the story is good and sometimes funny...all around a really fun game. if you are looking for a good gba rpg game don't pass this one up. plus it's successor just came out so you jump right into it as well."
1,Solid Drinking Water,This product cleans all the junk out of your water. I noticed a difference right away. No more weird taste or smell.
1,"Sure it's good, and a good price by the pund too!","A pretty good overview and a lot of in-depth material on Multivariate data analysis. Not quite a bed time read though.I recommend this book as part of your analytical library.If you liked this book, another good book on multivariate data analysis you may want to check out as well is Sharma, S.; Applied Multivariate Techniques, New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1996.If you want something easier to read/more practical, and you prefer SPSS over SAS you may want to check out either `Discovering Statistics using SPSS for Windows' by Andy Field, or probably even better/simpler `SPSS Survival Manual' by Pallant.Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC(...)"
1,EXIT,"I've waited for an album like this for a long time and i'm glad to see that it came out of Canada. K-OS is the all around artist: He writes his own lyrics, plays the guitar, hes an MC and even sings. Exit is an album constructed with intellect and experience. At A first listen you can easily hear the time and effort put into making this release. ""Patience"" one of my favorite tracks from the record, really connected to me at the time i first heard it, as i felt like he was writing a soundtrack to what was going on in my life at that time. ""Call Me"", ""Superstar"", ""Masquerade"" and ""Follow Me"" with fellow Canadian artist Red One (from the rascalz) are a few more of my favorites. If your looking for something different and artistically done well, then buy this album and support a revolution of quality and artistry."
1,FUN!!,"I had this book when I was in high school and loved it, think of it as a dictionary of Will. You can think of a word of emotion then look it up and see what Shakespeare wrote about it... if you love poetry, love Shakespeare, and you are a bit of a word geek this book is totally for you. Really wish there was a Kindle version I'd definitely down load it."
1,Tupac is the bomb,I have more respect for my man now that i've ever had in my life after reading this book. I've learned that he had come up through alot more than i thought. Thuglife Baby!!!!!!
1,The universal themes are timeless!,"Achilleus gets his broad taken away by Agamemnon and gets angry. Goes and cries to his mother, Thetis, who is also the god of the seas, and tells Zeus to help the Trojans defeat the Acheans in revenge for her son. Hektor of Trojans kills Achilleus' closse friend (4got his name) and decides to get revenge and kills Hektor. All of this pretty much progresses into the fall of Troy."
0,Don't Buy This Book - Borrow from the Library,"This is my first Scott Spencer book. I heard him on NPR discussing Man in the Woods. So, I borrowed A Ship Made of Paper (and Man in the Woods) from the library. And, I'm so glad that I didn't spend money on it. Dribble is the best word I can find to describe the content. I did finish the book, but was so tired of Daniel's whining and deceitfulness. I was bored by Iris and Kate's characters. It took over 2/3 of the book to reach the accident that was described on the flap of the cover. I kept waiting for whatever was going to happen - thinking that perhaps that would make the book more interesting. Based on reviews and articles about his writing, I had higher hopes for Mr. Spencer's novels. I will read Man in the Woods - and then decide if I will read other Scott Spencer books. In the meantime, borrow this one from the library."
0,not user friendly,"this item is not user friendly. it does not come with instructions on how to use it. when you click on an icon for help you can not get out of it (example: i clicked on ""help"" and could not click out of it. i had to actually leave the program to make it ""go away"".) this program probably would be fine with instructions on it's use. i find it very frustrating to not be able to use the tools if you don't know their functions!"
0,You can't trust an idiot like Moore if his movies are given free airtime in Islamic Iran,"Michael Moore movies are useless and full of lies. No doubt about it. However, what makes me give this moron a zero star rating is that his movies are all shown for free on Iranian regime run TV channels many times a year. Gee, you wonder why anti-American regime of Iran loves Michael Moore so much. His movies are truly worthless and based on lies he fabricates out of his hatred for the country which has given him the freedom to do so. Zero Star!"
0,Confused....,"Well I want to start off by saying that this is a very funny collection of Martin and Lewis and a great addition to any collection. The only problem is,I already have every single episode. Either the other reviewers got a different set or maybe they sent me the wrong one. I read in the reviews that I would be getting the Colgate skit where Dean adopts Jerry but that is nowhere to be seen. In my package was 2 cd's. The first one had At war with the Army and two Colgate's one with Rosemary Clooney and one with Polly Bergen. The second cd has three Colgates;Burt Lancaster,Tony Curtis,and Marilyn Maxwell.The only way it differs from the dvd set I already have is that this one has the original commercials. I was very disappointed and I hope that the next person buying this product gets what they were hoping for."
1,Home health products,"I purchased a Urinal from my local medical suppliar for close to three times the price Amazon's cost. Amazon's is truly high quality, and, it's made in America! The one from the medical suppliar is real-junk, made in China! I returned it and showed them Amazon's. I think they might buy from Amazon now. yuk-yuk.....I promptly ordered another one. I never considered Amazon would sell Urinals. The more we search, the more we find!"
1,"A Great Comeback, But Not As Great As All For You","(...)The 2004 album, Damita JO, falls in between her 2 previous classics. It's like she is trying to be Britney Spears, almost. This is a great comeback for Janet, but it is less focused and ambitious than any of her other works from 1986 through 1997. Damita Jo has a lot of dance-floor jams. The title-track, ""Just A Little While"" is a Rock-pop tune that has an 80's feel in it. I like it alot."
0,Cretinous Drivel,"This is utter drivel. I would as soon place a metric tonne of wombat's diarrhoea on my turntable (or indeed stuffed up the usb connector of an MP3 player with a nano-tube sized syringe)as listen to this slavering pile of purulent ejecta from a boil on a monkey's gonad. The ""singer,"" Nicky Tesco (can that really be his real name?)sounds more dated than a soiled packet of Green Shield stamps being shoved up Jimmy Savile alimentary canal from the tradesman's entrance. The entire oeuvre sounds more like an arthritic weasel with its todger being turned on a serrated centre-lathe with white-hot tweezers.Mr Tesco has however perhaps given us a valuable historical insight into the sound that King Edward II must have made during the period of his unfortunate demise at Pontefract Castle. One can only hope that a similar fate will overtake the egregious Mr Tesco in the very near future."
1,Great Resource for PowerBuilder Developer,This book is a great resource. Something you want to have besides you while developing PowerBuilder applications. The chapters on distributed development with PB 6 walk you through every step of development. I loved the book.
1,A real Christmas record,This is the one CD that re-energizes me every Christmas season. I heard Arbolito on the local NPR station (WCBE)years ago and ordered the CD online with next day delivery.
0,Example Winestore Application does not work on Linux,"After going through a lot of trouble, the winestore application does not work. I am sorry that I bought this book."
0,Speakerphone generates feedback,"The speakerphone on this phone is poor. If you turn the volume up to 2/3 or more, the phone generates high-pitched feedback. If you turn it down lower, the speaker is very quiet."
1,Old School Heavy Metal,"Piece of Mind is hands down in my opinion the best Iron Maiden album.All of their stuff is excellent yet this one has the hard edged hungry Iron Maiden that I love, this one put them in the main stream and Bruce Dickensons prescence was heavy and he was there to stay, Steve Harris plays a Bass guitar like no other and is also a heck of a song writer which he wrote the percentage of on this album, his Bass lines are heavy and untouchable. These guys stand in the front of the line when it comes to the hard bangers of their time. My hair might be graying and my gait is getting slower but I can still rock with the best of them when I put these guys on and turn it way up. Awesome! The Pc interaction section of this CD has two great videos on it and there are a bunch of other things available as well, buy the CD and see how far it will take you!! You'll never be the same again."
1,Heats a 3 car garage!,"Purchased this for my husband for woodworking in the garage. Heated the area to a very comfortable level despite single digit temperatures outside. Very pleased! Longmont,CO"
1,Regency Mystery,"An excellent continuation of a fine series. The atmosphere of Regency England is believable. While the villain was revealed about the middle of the story, more details of the protagonists past are revealed and a progress is seen in his character. You are left anticipating the next book in the series."
1,Really Enjoyed Material -,"Especially erecting the Giant Wind Turbine, though I found host Sean Riley's constant hyping irritating after awhile."
0,What in God's Green Earth Were They Thinking,"This movie gets one star because it has Tom in it. Not worth the time it takes you to press play. Theres only one question here. ""How much are you willing to pay me to see this movie?""."
1,Nothing bad to say,"Nothing bad to say about the product. Once I get a wood vice, I'll get to use them. See my review for the vice issue."
1,Skip a beat,"Although not a natural choice for a first single, ""Slow"" is nevertheless a great song. Funky, synth-laden, and unabashedly sexual, it does seem to deviate from other chirpy/frothy dance songs by entering into darker, more mature territory. Kylie sounds like she's undergone her own personal sexual revolution and the results are a smashing success. ""Sweet Music"" is a great track as well, lifting the mood a little bit and injecting some disco-style funkadelic beats. The ""Medicine 8 Remix"" might be nice if you were on ecstasy at a rave, but otherwise it just suffers from repetitive blandness. Finally, the video is a nice piece of visual work. Kylie performs the entire song lying down on a beach blanket. The gorgeous, oiled-up bodies cavorting around her are just a welcome bonus. Go ahead and buy it!"
1,good movie good movie in 3D is just so good.,this movie is great. and wen you watch it in 3D it is just so much better. go watch chicken little in 3D. you never sen anything like it. zach braff does a really cool job.
0,Hate it!,"This chair is horrible! The toy bar is too high and out to far for my baby to reach. When lifted over my baby's head and stored behind the chair, the toy bar slowly slides out of the bracket arms and falls to the floor. THe front feeding tray falls off when my baby kicks at it. It is impossible to recline the seat or move it forward with baby sitting in the chair because it is so difficult. The ""one hand height adjustment"" is anything but that! The basket that goes underneath the chair constantly falls off because you cannot attach it as explained in the manual due to a design flaw. I have been feeding my baby in his bouncy seat because it is easier than this highchair. We are going to buy a different highchair. We are looking at the Fisher Price Aquarium Healthy Care Highchair."
1,Best Stroller--single or double,"I have a 4 yr old and 3 mo old. This is my favorite stroller so far, and I have had many: maclaren single, maclaren double, graco metrolite, jeep jogger, and kohlcraft contours. I use the Joovy Caboose whether I have 2 children or one with me. The extra space is good for carrying my groceries, etc. It is steerable with one hand; in fact, when I have both kids, I pull a cart behind me and push this stroller with one hand. I found no other double I could manage with one hand. I haven't regretted my choice!"
1,Stunning !!,These are the best one can get for an amazingly low price !!I got these for 9$ on free shipping. Has been 2 years and they still are GREAT !The best testimonial would be that my friend was thrown in the pool with my headphones on and believe me - the headphones survived !!Superb Bass.. I just got an Altec Lansing behind the neck headphones for 16$ but the max sound is so low... nowhere near the Bass and power of Philips HS500 !Hats off !!
0,boring!!!,"No actual thinking is involved, only rote memorization of boring facts. Too many cards in a cumbersome size."
1,Good bedtime book for us,"PK Hallinan has a series of {insert relative) and I books. They are all enjoyable to read, and help to settle down our little ones at night. The all have subtle variations between them as they tell a short story about the special things children sometimes do with grandfathers, grandmother, and of course parents.Highly regarded in our house, and very inexpensive."
0,Absolute Junk,"The discs that I got were unbalanced and made my CD/DVD drive sound like it was tearing itself apart. Didn't bother returning them....just tossed them in the dumpster, where they belong!"
0,Cookie sheets,"These cookie sheets warped slightly on first use. Also the metal is stained from the cookies, I am now using parchment paper to make cookies on them. The price was ok, but I think I'd rather pay a little more next time, and get some that are more durable."
1,A Great Album by Firehouse--More consistent than their debut,"I like this album a great deal, and find it to be an overall stronger and more mature collection than FIREHOUSE, their debut album. Although this one doesn't have as many of the big hits (Love of a Lifetime, Don't Treat me Bad, and All She Wrote), it does have the great Top 10 ballad ""When I look into your eyes"" (These guys have always had a great touch with the ballads). Anyways, besides that hit, you'll also find several other great songs, including the rocking opener ""Reach for the Sky"", and my favorite song on the album, the ""Sleeping with You"", a goofy, rocking ode to getting some action. If you're a Firehouse fan, this is a definite must-own. As for new fans, you might want to go with the debut first, as it has most of the big hits, but FIREHOUSE, HOLD YOUR FIRE, and their new album CATAGORY 5 are the definite purchases for any Firehouse fan."
0,Tic Tacs,"I was pleased with the fast shipment, however, they were supposed to be orange tic tacs and they were all white. I didn't know this until the bridal shower when people opened them b/c the package was a dark orange and made the tic tacs appear to be orange too. Too late to send back at that point."
1,Best Stuff Ever !!,"In case you need to save up to buy the set, you can listen to them on Pandora.that is where I first discovered themjust search for Carl Reiner Mel Brooks.As others have said, this humour is timeless and hilarious."
0,Defective pair,The strap broke within 6 weeks of receiving the item. Our now 19 month old has another pair of Crocs (lego blocks) that she has worn more and those are still fine. Her previous pair she was able to wear until she outgrew with no problems.I am very frustrated I cannot return/exchange these when it seems I must have received a defective pair.
1,AWESOME Transmitter!,"This is the best way to play your ipod in the car. It is so great! It comes in crystal clear, better than a CD! It is so easy to use, I tune it into 88.9 in VT and there is NO static whatsoever. Simply the best, I have tried quite a few others and this one is amazing! You have to get it. This is the best price around as well. Most places sell it for 100.00!"
0,Zero Stars For Dull,"Do not listen to the film buffs who call this ""art"" and a series of vignettes that defy any meaning, its worthless and boring. The whole film has no interest to offer, what it tends to portray is stuffy French poseurs who smoke and talk about nothing in particular, that isn't very entertaining. I was dragged to the ending finally and was exhausted by the absolute uselessness of this picture and of Godard himself who isn't a very capable film director."
0,boo-hoo,I am a girl. I never skate boarded ever. It does'nt intrest me. Santa got me a silver hi-tide board. Hi-Tide! from the makers of the wave it said on the box. I got teary eyed. I didn't try it. My dad did and fell off. I'll never use it. I like dolls and animals. I'm a tom boy but not a 'gnarly grinder.I'm only 9. Box said ages8 and up. We are returning it. Buy this to break someone's heart!
0,Shun and Wustoff user,"Purchased the Kyocera Revolution 7"" ceramic knife because of the general hype about them. I currently use Shun and Wustoff knives that I have had for years. I think my Shun and Wustoff knives are far sharper than the Kyocera. Even when cutting a shallot I find there is more effort used with the ceramic knife than the Shun or the Wustoff. Although it does do a good job with tomatoes and vegetables. Meat and fish are pretty much the same as a metal knife.If I had to choose one knife to do all jobs,..it would be a non-ceramic knife and I would wash, hone and store immediately.If I could I would return the Kyocera."
0,Forget about the root kit and focus on the music -- which is only okay,"Santana is like an old oak tree -- some years there's an abundance of acorns, and other years there's a scarcity. This is a lean season, as the music seems more like muzak at times. I don't fault his effort, but the outcomes are not what his hard core fans look for. But like the mighty oak, Santana endures, and there no doubt will be other, more plentiful seasons ahead."
1,Nice inexpensive iPod cables,"I bought several of these for myself and my sister and I was pleased that they really worked. I use one in my car to hook my iPod to my stereo and as long as I leave my iPod alone and don't move it around too much, it works great. Sometimes it gets bumped and the connection is lost, but that doesn't happen very often."

1,What A Huge Difference.,"The only other whey protein powder I'd tried in the past was EAS Myoplex, specifically a flavor they tried to make palatable by calling it Cookies and Cream. Imagine gagging down a tumbler of pus from a large abscess.What a relief to find Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold Standard. I got a couple 5 lb containers each of the French Vanilla Cream and the Extreme Milk Chocolate. I mix either with non-fat milk, a heaping tbsp of PB2 powdered peanut butter and some whole ground flax seed meal, and the result is killer. Awesome for breakfast, before a workout and after.I'm sold on this stuff."
0,Overrated,I'm not sure why Ender's Game is rated so highly. It does not really introduce any amazing concepts. The main character being good at video games does not really excite me.
0,It's a horrible nightmare!,"I got this machine, because my husband said: ""because it's the most expensive it must be the best"".It wasn't. The poop was there and it was in the litterbox. So I had to clean it up by myself.So we paid extra money and I had to clean up like if I had the normal litter box. My cat even pee on the floor. It was horrible tosee the way that box was looking. I had to clean it up 3 times a day, and besides, I had to see all the residues of the disgrace that the machine does.This doesn't work properly, so it will leave everything on top, with a horrible smell. If you can, don't get it.Save your money!"
0,Beware of problems with Outlook email!,"I purchased this product after reading a lot of Amazon review and thought this was going to be easy to set up and troubleshoot. Well to Linksys's credit I had no problems hooking the router to my DSL model and my 2 computers (1 desktop and 1 laptop). Even my internet connection works great and setting up everything took very little time. But I've been having nothing but PROBLEMS with email!. There is a whole lot of trouble getting and sending mail. Calling Linksys and getting someone to help you is literally impossible. Even after they call you back after 4 days (yes, 4 days) their tech support agents are quite incompetent.Most DSL providers do not support a DSL router, so you are stuck. I am still trying to fix my email and its over a month since I bought this product. I would suggest that you check out other products (esp. how good their tech. support is) before purchasing Linksys."
0,Weird,"Weird case, strange book. Karen Kingsbury had never become a novelist: she has no ability to create depth of character. Therefore Missy is a one-dimensional saint and her killers are demons. Actually, all of the characters in this odd tale were quite unlikeable. And those re-created conversations are clumsy and unrealistic. But this book, I will admit, is a page-turner in the way that the Jerry Springer show sometimes fascinates me against my will: I kept thinking as I was reading, 'Do people really live like this?'"
