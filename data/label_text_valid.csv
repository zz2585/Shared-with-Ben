0,Needs a Wizard,I think this book leaves a lot to be desired. The author seems to have been churning out the material without enough regard for the reader.
0,Writing so bad it was painful.,"The writing and storytelling in this book was so unoriginal, it read like a parody. This could have been an overacted, overdramatized skit on SNL. And if the style of writing wasn't bad enough, the villain was obvious well before reaching the halfway mark of the book."
0,save your cash,"waste of money, very basic advice, most of which you can find in this month's issue of Cosmo. Also, no photos which would be helpful rather than trying to decipher what they are saying."
1,Yorkshire gold,I appreciate how i can smell the freshness and strength of this tea just by taking the plastic off the box. The aroma is amazing and it taste like luxury...
0,Very poor quality and no support,I bought the first device and while I could hear fine the person on the other end heard either a really bad echo or words were being dropped. I sent it back and tried another one with the exact same results. Contacted their tech support online and never received an answer. I tried both devices on three different computers with the same result. I can use a headset connected to the sound card with excellent phone quality so it is not the network connection. I would not recommend this device.
0,Yawn! Played Out!,"although this game is being sold under Half- Life it is so boring, it took me 35 min. to complete it. Like the review above says the 3d engine is old and played out. Everyone else is releasing new 3d engines, and this company is still working off of this 4 year old engine. The game is short and boring. I think barney should have been put to bed before they thought this one up."
0,Interested in programming? This book isn't for you...,"If you're interested in the actual programming of Java then this book is not for you. I found it to actually be worthless and definately not helpful to me at all. It does include some applets but if you want applets you can find the same things online and not pay a dime. If you're still interested in buying this book E-mail Me, I'm willing to sell it for a reasonable price."
1,OMG A CAT OWNER'S DREAM,I bought this to keep the cat hair under control. It is the perfect thing. i have a large vacuum that neither my husband or I like to use because it is a big pain in the neck to lug it out and up and down stairs. i wanted something to use in between the big clean ups and this is OUTSTANDING. I have a three level house and i use this on all my hard wood floors and one area rug. i was shocked how much cat hair this thing picked up off the rug (the cats think its theirs) i actually was embarrassed by how much hair i got. it is wonderful and it is the perfect solution to those quick run arounds - i use it every couple of days to keep the tumble weeds at bay.
0,Disappointed In John Sandford,"I felt t was a waste of money and time - I did not finish this book - first time in many years. I have read most of Sandford's books - but could not follow this one - It was just very, very boring. The only little flavor in the book was reading about LuEllen - did not even turn to the last page - couldn't care at all.."
1,Bugaboo Frog Fits,"I use this bag to store my Bugaboo Frog. I didn't want to spend alot on the Bugaboo brand transport bag, since I am not using this bag for air travel. Everything fits, including all the accessories. If you wanted it to be even flatter, you could take the wheels off the chassis. I probably would not use it for air travel for the Bugaboo since this bag doesn't have any padding."
0,Outlets very close together.,"This surge protector will work if all your plugs are of conventional size. I have an air conditioner and timer plug that are fairly large, and cover more than their own outlet. As a result, I am returning this product. A design flaw in my opinion, and not reflected accurately in the picture."
0,One weird thing,"So, the princess seat part isn't attached to the pink part with the handles. It's weird. It falls off when you move it at all. I ended up duct taping them together. FYI. It's still a good product, I was just really surprised that they're not attached to each other. So weird."
1,...But Someone Has To Do It...,"Love it...Solid writing, excellent character studies, an overall wonderful effort at delving into the heart of the human condition and so damn funny...As with all of my Moore reading experiences, I find aspects of Moore's psyche a little hard to digest, but the read is well worth the potential heartburn .Christopher Moore is for what ails you..."
0,Haven't finished but it's a bust..,It's far harder to play this one compared to prince of persia the sands of time even with a walkthrough I will be scratching my head (and that's the video one that gives you step by step tutorials)this story wasn't to my liking I'm sure some like these type of in depth games if you like a very hard game buy it..otherwise don't.
0,An embarrasment to Laurel and Hardy,"None of these are Laurel and Hardy films and all of them are so bad that no one bothered to renew the copyrights on them. Most of these were made before they were a team, and the rest are guest appearances they should have avoided. For die-hard fans ONLY - and even they might regret the purchase."
1,Nice little starter bow,"Good for children 8 and up. shoots accurately to about 20 ft, I would recommend only for fun but not serious archery."
0,Stay away from Danze!,"We built our new home 5 years ago and installed Danze brand plumbing fixtures at the recommendation of our contractor's plumber. The soft touch personal shower (wand) on our Roman tub may have worked a month before failing. We have since replaced it three times, during which time the manufacturer changed the internal working design. (My first clue that there would be additional problems.) Of course, we have had to pay plumbers each time for their work to replace the faucet. And today it still doesn't work. Danze, pretty faucets, they just don't work. We have also had problems with the standard shower fixture in our guest bathroom numerous times. (also Danze) Their customer service department has always been kind. But their product is simply inferior."
0,Too hard to read,"Hi, I just received the DW5600-E yesterday and am very disappointed. The display is small and hard to read. The digits are black on a dark gray background, just like the picture on this page. There is very little contrast. It gives me a headache to read the time in all but the brightest light. I doubt I will be wearing this watch very much. I wish I would have gotten one of the G Shocks with the auto backlight feature. That way, every time I tilt the watch to read it, it will light up for me."
0,BAD,"Just to start off, it is impossible to even get any good sound out of these speakers. I got these with the dell, and they have nice sound, but the volume is really bad. The volume control is in a bad spot (ON TOP OF THE RIGHT SATTELITE) really annoying. Also, you can get much better sound out of the JBL creature speakers, JBL invaders, and the JBL soundsticks. All of the JBLs sound better and look much better with an apple. These speakers are made to look good with PCs which they do, but NOT AN iBook!!!!! They sound okay, don't look great, for speakers they are just mediocre."
1,Don't pass this one up,"I think FWX is fantastic. I was reluctant at first to buy it, after hearing some blurbs but I am glad i did. I can't wait for the next one."
1,The Hero's Journey.,"This is a great little story. I wish I'd thought of it. Everything I want to say about this will destroy the enjoyment of the ending. It's clever, fun and more than this, it's the concluding chapter to some of the greatest legends of western lore. Not to be missed."
1,"Wife loves the perfume, I love the price","After searching for this at the mall (Penney's, I believe) for a shade over $90, we decided to check online. Very impressed with the price (less than half of what Penney's priced it at), the checkout was simple, and the delivery very speedy."
0,A great transfer to DVD; a far from great movie.,"I first saw Tower of Evil when I was ten years old and remembered being scared by that viewing. After just recently seeing it for the second time, I discovered that the film has lost much of its punch. The film starts off strong leading the viewer to a gruesome discovery and a path of mystery waiting to be revealed. Then things slow down. I don't mean just applying the brakes, I'm talking putting it on the parking gear! Towards the end it began to pick up, but the final ""twist"" felt very flat to me. However, I must give a strong Kudos to Elite Entertainment for their brilliant job in the remastering of this film. The picture quality is excellent and the cinematography beautifully stands out. I hope in the future, Elite does this sort of fine work on better films. I recommend this to the slasher movie completist only."
1,WHEN BATTLING WAS FUN,"SHAN AND KRS-ONE DID IT BACK 'ROUND '86-'89,HAVING THESE SONGS ON ONE LP FROM MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO,HISTORY BABY. OLD SCHOOL LIVES. KRS AND SHAN SHOULD HAVE KICKED SOME NEW MATERIAL,BUT THIS REMINDER WILL DO,UNTIL...?"
0,"awful reception, virtually useless","the headline says it all, very poor quality, terrible sound unless you like listening to electrical interference and the like."
1,I love Allison Hobb's Books!!,"Allison Hobbs is a wonderful writer! If you haven't read at least one of her books, you don't know what you are missing. I have read every single one of her books, can't wait for her to write more! This book was a great book that totally engaged my attention and kept me on the edge of my seat.I was so happy for Dayna in the ending. Reed was CRAZY!! This story could be anyone's story. A definite must-read. Loved it! Can't wait to read Hobbs' next book, ""Bonafide Golddigger."" I am RUNNING to the bookstore to get it her writing is so good! No disappointments here!"
0,there's more out there,"Just discarding glasses and actually beginning to use your vision a little differently can be enough to improve your vision a little, but I believe that complete relief of blurred vision will be obtained only rarely by just the methods described in this book. And the descriptions of the methods are very brief, leaving much open to guesswork and luck.This book is a component of the See Clearly Method, which includes aspects of the Bates method but this book is more mechanical and physically-oriented than the Bates method. The See Clearly Method has been advertised heavily and attracted a relatively large amount of attention compared to the Bates method, and this book has become popular as well, but there is a great deal more information about vision improvement out there than is contained in this book, and I invite you to research the subject further.I am an advocate of the Bates method."
0,"""Teach them the hard truth while they are young""","This book is considered a classic, but after reading it as an adult I can see the real message behind the story. Goldie Locks strolls trough the woods and comes across your the bear house. She then proceeds to break into your home, use your stuff, eat your food, and pass out in your bed. Then, when the bears come home and catch her asleep, mother bear (who looks like Mammie from ""Gone With The Wind"") tells her she can come back any time she feels like it. In a nutshell this is a children's version of actual events involving Nordic European settlers who roll in and claim everything as theirs. The only thing missing from this story is rape and smallpox. Aside from the historical resemblence, do you really want your children to think it's ok to roam into your neighbors house while they are out? If so, I would hate to be on the recieving end of a phone call from your neighbor or the police."
0,Very disappointed,"This game falls far short of expectations. The best part of the game is the creature creator, which you can download for free. The game is split into 5 stages. The first 4 stages are fun, but don't offer much challenge, don't take very long to complete, and don't offer much replayablility. The final stage (the spage stage) is obnoxious through and through. The final stage is very frustrating, and when its not frustrating, its repetitive and boring.I believed the hype. When the creator of The Sims says that they are coming out with a revolutionary Sim everything game, I believe it, but sadly it is not so. Compared to The Sims, this game doesn't rate well at all. I only wish their was a way to get my money back.I, personally, don't have an issue with the DRM. But I do have an issue with how this game was marketed. I feel duped and I wont be buying any EA titles or Will Wright games."
1,The Last Samurai - Blu-ray,"This is an outstandingly written, directed and acted film with a fascinating subject matter, the Japanese Samurai. The Blu-ray copy is an upgrade from the DVD in sound and picture quality. Bonus Features are excellent. Highly recommend this film."
0,Get what you pay for,"rather than spending an extra $10, I bought this one. useless. maybe it's just the one I got, but it's blurry. I had one (that was left in a cart) that I used to find my ball more than for distances, but this one can't focus on anything. you get what you pay for."
0,Thief,"Brian denies stealing the melody of his biggest hit (""Anytime,"" 1997) from 1993's ""Outside Your Door"" by Meshell Ndegeocello (listen to a sample at ASIN B0027GYP8S). The song ""Talk To Me,"" which gives credit to Meshell under her birth name, was published in 1991 byVoyceboxing. You will find the same melody on ""Talk To Me"" (1991), which also appears on ""Outside Your Door"" on Meshell's 1993 debut albumPlantation Lullabies. Brian's rip off was released several years later in 1997. Ever since then, McKnight has denied the theft of Meshell Ndegeocello's melody from ""Outside Your Door"" -- the part of the song that makes ""Anytime"" so popular.It's been nearly 15 years. You would think at some point Mr. McKnight would want to clear his conscience and do the right thing."
0,cologne is different,"Be careful, this cologne is a different color and does not smell like the real bottle from the dept store is it the same? it said Eau De Toilette spray vaporizer on the bottle."
1,Birthday gift for a friend,"I bought this for a friend for his birthday. He loved it. Fit him perfectly, great quality, it did shrink a little but not too bad."
0,statistical nonsense,"Dr. Strosahl alleges that hospitalization does not reduce the incidence of suicide ands offers statistical proof that the incidence of suicide is greater in psychiatric hospitals than it it is outside of psychiatric hospitals. By this logic all cancer wards should be cleared since the death rates from cancer are substantially highter in hospitals than they are in the population at large. Dr. Strosahl also writes that mental health professionals should never be held to have met the test of foreseeability for a patients suicide after taking into consideration all of the patients risk factors. That begs the question, Why bother doing a patient suicide risk assessment at all?"
1,Star Stuff,"Jaci Velasquez is such a rare person. Her way is decidely pop, and at times with a christian angle; somewhat like Amy Grant. She is often snubbed by the Christian music community because few of her songs even get close to Christian music. At 16yo on this debut recording, she shows a remarkable range, and confidence in her abilities and reception. She is multi-octave, comfortably bi-lingual, drop dead gorgeous, and with less than flashy plummage. She's easy to take, and easier to love. Why this gifted person isn't recognized as one of the world's greatest songstress, and hell-uva great person, must lie in the fact she was initially presented as a Christian artist. That's fine. Her stated goal is to make people feel better about themselves. Jaci Velasquez has everything!"
1,Great movie,"You know, I was really surprised at how good this film was. I went into it thinking it was gonna be cheesey, and it was good. Action packed and full of fun. I've watched it twice so far in just to days of having it. I think you will be happy with a purchase of DOA."
0,Not that great,"I'm surprised at how poorly this rice cooker works, considering all of the great reviews posted here. I followed the instructions provided, filling up the cooker with the appropriate amount of water & rice, and after about six uses, it hasn't cooked properly even one time. I always have to add about twice as much water. The manual also states that brown rice takes longer to cook, it should also say to add a lot more water. The cover doesn't seem to fit very well and inevitably, water collects on the outside of the lid while cooking.Finally, rice always burns on the bottom because the unit gets so hot - it doesn't burn so that it's not still edible, but it becomes brown and a bit rubbery.Overall, I'm not impressed with this unit at all and I would not recommend it to anyone."
0,Not worth Buying,"Just purchased this device 10 days ago (May 19, 2009). I have only RCA devices and this remote barely works with any of them. I was trying to replace an older remote that is no longer available, and even though it is in disrepair the older one still works better than this one.Main complaint is that when you select a device that you want to communicate with it only stays with that device for 1 button push. Then you have to select the device again. That is a real pain in the butt.I thought maybe that I just needed to select the right codes for my devices since it didn't seem to be working as I thought it should, but that was a big mistake. Using Code search rendered the remote completely useless with no instructions for how to get it back to the default.I now have a useless hunk of plastic."
1,Just as Advertised,Showed up on time for Mother's Day and my Mom loved it. Has enough heft so it doesn't look cheap and it's survived more than a few NY winters with all of the accompanying salt with no signs of rust or any worse for the wear. Good value and good gift for a true Yankees fan.
1,HP JetDirect 620n Print Server (J7934A#UUS),"Worked like a charm, just plug and played it. Works smoothly on a HP DesignJet 111 Roll. Later got it sent to Chile via-second courier company called Aeropost. I had it in my hands 6-8 days after I bought it. Nice."
1,"LOVE THE WOMB SOUNDS AND LIGHTS, BUT....","SOUNDS AND LIGHTS ARE LOVELY... but when its in the voice mode it doesn't turn on quick, it takes about 50 sec of real LOUD crying before it turns on (it is inside the crib). By the time it turns on, the baby is really upset and sounds and lights are not enough anymore, so I'd rather get up and turn it on manually before the baby gets upset.*A good thing is that it doesn't turn on when you are talking, I tested it by speaking loud and very close to it and it didn't turn on... it turns on, only with crying sounds* I WISH IT COULD BE MORE SENSITIVE TO CRYING LIKE SOUNDS... those sounds that baby makes before it starts the real loud crying.I would recommend it because it really sooths a baby!"

1,Picture doesn't match,"If you are inclined to buy based upon looks, you might look again. While the online image shown doesn't match the original part, the one that shipped did fit the DLC-10 P food processor. Snug fit. Be more careful when you attach it to the processor. It will last longer."
0,Mindless and unoriginal,"I must say that after having watched this I was offended that a friend had recommended it to me. I have no problems with the movie's message; my problem is with its complete lack of originality. I cannot recall an original moment in this entire movie. What I can recall is gratuitous edginess and a mindless collection of plotlines and vignettes ripped from movies like Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, and the Professional. I understand that in watching a film like this one needs to suspend a measure of disbelief, but this film asks its viewers to be idiots. The dialogue is terrible and the scenarios the characters find themselves in are often moronic. It seems like Duffy had a whole list of ""Holy ****, wouldn't it be cool if..."" moments and strung them together and expected them to make a movie. My only real wish is to have my 108 minutes back. Be thankful that the sequel never made it off the ground."
1,The Rock Typhoon,"A really bright new star in the sky of the nu-metal universe. The incredible combination of a melody and an aggressiveness, of a wall-crushing power, and a fragile beauty makes Ill Nino really something to listen to, and to enjoy.God Save Us, and What Comes Around are really great hits that are known widely. The most melodic, still heavy enough, tracks are perhaps Unreal, No Murder, and Predisposed. If You Still Hate Me, Nothing's Clear, Liar, Rumba, I Am Loco, Rip Out Your Eyes, and /Revolucion are full of energy and heaviness, and readily please anyone who're used to some heavier music. With You is a nice latin guitars acoustic, with a soft vocals, and a nice melody; makes the band shine in the different and original light.The unavoidably essential part of any real rock music fan's collection, a must-have for any nu-metal lover."
0,what do you mean don't call him?,If a woman doesn't want to call the man after a breakup relationship maybe she is either [gay or intimidated] by him. Sometimes women should do what it takes to make it work. Rhonda Findling got a lot to learn.
0,Not Worth It,"I didnt buy this from Amazon, but after some time my drive also stopped working. I dont know how were going to recover all the photo's we put on this drive. Its not worth your time to try to save photo's on a drive that will eventually stop working and you cant recover your information. Very dissapointed."
0,NOT HAPPY,Wish I could write a review on Return to Krondor.But thats not what you sent me. The book Krondor the Betrayal that you sent me is green in color and looks good on my shelf. The video game in the back of the book says it has Return to Krondor and Betrayal at Krondor on it.But it doesn't. You have my money and I have your JUNK.Thank YouJim
1,Good bra,"Good support.I have a D-sized breasts, and, without proper support, exercising is a problem , especially running.I hate it when my breasts ""jump"". This bra provides good support but does not squeeze them.Also, I do sweat a lot, and this bra does not keep you wet under it.Overall, good support and comfortable wear."
0,Disappointing product,"Many of the cards were confusing. Cards easily bent, storage not great. No system to what is being presented and geo safari ""computer"" is difficult for little ones to use. The whole system was a real disappointment."
1,Good stuff,Needed something cheap added to my order for free shipping and this fit the bill. I'm a tea drinker so always up for new flavors. Having the green tea roasted gives it sort of a nutty flavor which is nice.
0,"aimee ""beattles"" mann","in the liner notes of ""Magnolia"" Paul Anderson feels that he has heard these songs before. No kidding? That's because her songs aren't all that creative and mann sounds like she wants to join a Beattles reunion tour. I think the majority of this problem comes from the production work of John Brion, who tends to make everything into one big mess( i.e. Fiona Apple 2nd record, Rufus wainwright, etc.) I'm not blaming him liking the Beattles, I blame him for not being innovative enough to break things up more. But I did like the song ""Driving Sideways"" produced by Mann and Rage Against the Machine producer brenden O' Brien, who I think, is much more versatile than Brion."
1,Transition,"This represents Dave transitioning to pop-hood. Money-makin', ain't nothing wrong with that,... just don't get soft."
0,"poor quality, burned/shorted out in 12 hours","I was able to install this adapter on my Windows XP Dell, and it worked with my household wireless network, at least for a while. The next time we went into the room, less than 12 hours later, it had shorted out. It smelled like an electrical fire and (of course) the little indicator lights were not on any more. The quality of this expensive speed booster adapter is awful, awful, awful. Read these reviews. Do NOT buy this product."
1,Sammy does it again,"I live in Australia and am an avid fan of SH (he actually toured here about 7 years ago). However, over the last few years, I've noticed a lack of product at our record stores. Having tracked down his website I discovered this album which was never released here. It's interesting to get an album that is actually ""between"" others I've heard - it allows you to judge it on its own merits as opposed to comparing it to the last offering.I reckon this is one of his best, good punchy riffs and his voice is at full stretch - much more consistent than, say, Marching to Mars or Red Voodoo (sorry couldn't help myself).It rarely let's up and as such is a perfect driving companion.Can't wait for any new stuff!"
0,stench,"The singer doesn't sing, for goodness sake. He just talks. I guess that's the band's trademark, but I flat out hate it. I wouldn't really like the tracks if he had sung overtop of them either, because the whole album in general stinks. Don't buy this CD. It's unique, but unimpressive."
1,Better than Ever,"I have been watching Dr Who since 1980. I have every episode and movie ""lost"" or otherwise that is available. Of course I could not wait for the US release, and got mine out of country. The show is different than the originals, and as much as I love the original I think this season is the best. The stories are wonderful (yes some are better than others) Captian Jack is great. The final scene with Rose in episode 13 is one of the finest moments in 27 seasons. The tardis packaging and the widescreen format are an added plus. I think the price for the season is a real bargain for fans."
1,Classic Cash,"Read the CD jacket while you listen. He doesn't claim to be a great guitarist or a great singer, he just tells it how it was. You will love listening to the quiet tall man over and over again."

0,Only Amazon.com Purchase I ever returned,"I bought this book with the best of intentions, however the lessons were stilted and labored. I continued reading on hoping to find something valuable I could take away from the book, but in the end I came away with nothing. In being fair to the author, I suppose if you are a complete beginner, this book may hold some value, however if you have spent any amount of time writing in any form, there is little here that will aid you in your quest to write flash fiction.This was the only Amazon.com purchase I have returned in all the years and hundreds of books I have purchased. If you have read any books on writing in the past, please don't waste your money. I ended up losing in the end because I paid for shipping and was hit with some other fee, so I actually paid over $5 to read the book. Oh well."
0,Amazon mp3 downloader fail,"This may be the greatest album ever, but I would not know because the Amazon mp3 downloader simply would not work. From the first attempt I was forced to reinstall the downloader and again for 13 subsequent attempts - even including working with Amazon tech support, I could never get the music on my box.This was several weeks ago and despite assurances from Amazon I have never been notified of a correction.I used to love Amazon mp3 music. I have probably downloaded in excess of 50 albums. Unfortunately the download software has become bugging and not reliable. It is a shame because Amazon has a great library to choose from and relatively fair pricing."
0,Time not Accurate,I had ordered this clock and loved it and then ordered two more and the new ones and the old ones pluged in next to each other keep different time!I thought the idea of the clock was to know you always had the correct time?
1,Great Show but the DVDs...,"I have always been a big fan of the show, it has a good combination of humor and ""drama"". My boyfriend got me the entire series for my birthday and it is a nice box, every season has features and some commentaries. The only issue that one may have with the DVDs is that Seasons 1-5 (not sure about 6 and 7 because I didn't get that far yet) is that there isn't a ""Play All"" option. You have to play the episodes one at the time which can be kind of annoying if you are trying to have a ""marathon"", but it's perfect if you are watching the entire series while running on the treadmill (that's why I gave it 5 stars). One of the discs was scratched and therefore one of the episodes skipped, but other than that it was a great gift. I guess if that would bother someone they could send the entire thing back, but I didn't think it was worth the trouble of mailing the heavy box for 1 disc.I saw there is another more expensive box set and perhaps the DVDs there are set up differently."
1,All Aboard Airplanes,"All Aboard Airplanes is a great book! This book is what made me interested in airplanes. I now Know all sorts of facts about planes, and I want to be a pilot when I grow up. Plese buy this book for any plane loving child you know."
1,The Real Mr. Bond,"When I was growing up in the 80's I was told that the worst James Bond movie ever was OHMSS with George Lazenby, so I always thought so. When i finally saw the movie I realized it was one of the best. George Lazenby was the ideal model for Bond. He did a great job period. He was never given a fair shot at the position.Telly Savalas was Blofeld. All Blofelds before and after were weak next to him. He was smart, scary, and active. He did not just give orders, he was part of the chase, a true villian.Diana Rigg was not a Bond Girl, she was a true heroine. She was smart, sexy and her own woman. The chemistry between Lazenby and Rigg was there on screen.The soundtrack is what makes this movie. When you hear the music when Bond is being chased you feel as if you are there. This is one of the best Bond soundtracks.Sean Connery is best Bond because of the body of his work. Maybe Bond would not have turned into camp with DAF and the Roger Moore Bonds if Lazenby had stayed."
0,Unnecessary Purchase,I purchased the cable as suggested by Amazon as other items to buy along with the purchase of my HDTV. Upon installation I found that the cable was unnecessary for the average TV installation. I did return the cable for a partial refund. This was a bad purchase for a dollar loss.
0,"Terrible, buy an Ultra 2000VA UPS","This item is terrible. The problem is that it constantly monitors the quality of the incoming 120V line. If that 120V outlet in anything less than absolutely perfect this awful gadget starts beeping endlessly and stops working. So every time my neighbor opens his garage door and the voltage of my 120V outlet drops a fraction for a second this piece of junk starts beeping endlessly as if it were the end of the world. I wanted a simple battery to power my PC for a few minutes when the power fails, not a complicated idea. This thing instead monitors my homes 120V system and beeps loudly and constantly any time there is the slightest variation. I did not buy a gadget to monitor my homes electrical system, I wanted a battery to power my PC in case of power failures. Totally useless. Does not do what it is supposed to do. $30 in shipping to return due to weight. I didnt even try the software."

1,Dekker's Heaven trilogy introduction,"This small book provides background information for Ted Dekker's Heaven trilogy, _Heaven's Wager_, Heaven Weeps_, and _Thunder of Heaven_. The book fills in a lot of details to which Dekker reveals in the three books. Throughout the book there is an intimate sense of the presence of Heaven in all our lives. This is a story of sacrifice without regret and of the costliness of redemption for all of us. As Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote, Grace is not cheap, it cost God the life of His son. I recommend this book and the trilogy for which it is a prequel. The four books inspired me to a closer walk with God."
1,Weapon of MASS TENDERIZATION!,"Be careful! The tips are sharp ... and there are lots of them.I've used this meat tenderizer only twice, but it worked GREAT!It fits in my hand well, pierces the meat easily, and cleans up just fine in the dishwasher. What more could I ask for?"

0,Shipping rip off,looking for a time stamp document and came across this device....did not buy and willl not from this company$78 for shipping??
1,"Mt favorite time of year ""September"".",I like the authors books and was not disappointed in September. The detail of the families lives makes you feel that you are living at that time right along with the characters. There are certain things that were written that I will never forget! I liked this book very much
0,"We are Scooby Doo book fiends, and this was not a winner!","To my 7 year old and I, the device of ""seeing the ghosts"" detracted from the storyline immensely. The storyline was very poor in comparison to the rest of Mr. McLeon's books. Also, we could feel the invisible ghosts on the pages, but couldn't see them."
1,Nice cd,"I so love this cd, she is absolutely marvelous, i know it's a long time since i got it, but no better time than the present"
1,Synopsis,"An interplanetary alliance known as the Weave arrives on Earth looking for allies in its desperate war with the Amplitature. What they discover is a species that, despite the denials of a human composer they find, has an astounding combination of strength, agility, intelligence, adoptability and above all, aggression. They decide to recruit this planet in the war only to find that they have made an alliance with a species that they need, but do not want"
0,It leaks!,"I would give this tub a good review, IF it didn't leak. But, IT DOES LEAK. It is helpful in every other way, but you always have to wipe up the water afterwards. I believe it is leaking from where the thing slides together at. Anyway... try getting a tub that does NOT slide apart, one that is all in one piece."
0,ahhhh!,"this book is boreing! if you like fantasy, check out the dragonlance books. the first dl book is around 400 pages and this thing is like 6 or 8 hundred but look at the typing! its freakin huge!"
0,Hocus Pocus? More like Mumbo Jumbo...,"I wanted to give it less than one star, but there was no such rating on the system. The cover alone was enough to warn me about the validity (or lack thereof) of this book. As I have read several books on Witchcraft/Wicca, the first thing I looked at (after the cover of course) was the love spell(s). The spell/s listed actually required you to take the bodily secretions or hair clippings from your intended victim, & use those things to bind this person to you.As a practitioner, I know that this is simply wrong. It goes completely against the principles of ""harm none"" and ""free will."" You can't ""make"" someone fall in love with you, no matter what anybody may tell you. All relationships must be fostered over time.For romance or friendship, try going to a bookstore or coffee shop--and actually striking up a conversation. It's very simple and it actually works!"
0,quick read but gets annoying just as fast!,"I am not an 'older mommie' but do have a preemie and she was one of two. There are some really fun moments in this book. However the people in it are are pretty self centered. I enjoyed the parts about henry and gus. The nanny has got to got though. She acts as if she is paying the mother. The father of these children is an old crab. Ms newman is pretty much a single mother. There is one statement in these book that was stupid. She states that a woman who could get rid of her dog, can just as easily get rid of her child. What the heck? Yet, as another poster stated she at one point wishes her children dead. This is a woman who starts off with around the clock help from a nanny!!"
0,Totally Impractical,I am extremely disappointed with this set. The filling holes are entirely too small (approx. the size of a dime). I will not be using them at all and will donate them to Habitat for Humanity so that perhaps someone can get some use out of the salt and pepper shakers.
0,Expensive ~ Go To Your Local Feed Store,"I am continually amazed at how much pet stores and retailers selling pet supplies charge for basic stuff. Feline Pine is no exception. I switched my multiple cat household to pine pellets, and for the first time EVER, I don't smell cat urine. However, I don't buy Feline Pine. Go to your local feed store and buy the 44 pound equine bedding pellets for about $6-7 per bag. HUGE savings and the same stuff!"
0,At least act like you care,"I had previously ordered three other literary posters. They were carefully rolled and when I opened the package they were in perfect shape.This last one was shipped alone in a package that cost about 6.00 which made the poster twice as much. Well, I wouldn't have cared except that poster had been folded in half and then half again. Some idiot did a real number on it and now I have to pay for shipping it back. I will never order from this company again. What a waste of time and effort."
0,Not as good as MI2,"Lots of action, but not a lot of surprises. Worth renting but not buying. Great action, good actors, but not good enough. A disappointment."
0,Don't waste your money!,Buy or borrow the book and don't waste your money on this useless bit of information.
1,Chris Jericho and Fozzy are spectacular!,"Whether you are a wrestling fan or not, this is a true metal cd for anyone who loves the 80's style of heavy metal. This has great guitar work, jamming, pure energy, and just screams out charisma all over it! This album is great from start to finish, you should also check out the first Fozzy record!"
1,this is 4 star without a doubt,"This album is one of my personal top 10. I just heard it recently and can,t understand why it did not top charts. This is a must have CD for anyone who likes alternative/rock. Here is one of the rare albums that has no garbage. Songs 1-12 are play em loud, roll the windows down, this is what life's about songs."
0,Maggie and Annie - not your typical romance,"I've seen a lot of lesbian romance movies. Some are cute, some are steamy, some are full of angst and unrequited love.This one is none of those things. As it strives to convey a sense of reality, a sense that not all decisions are easy, and that some can love more than one person, it loses focus.From poor sound quality (had the TV all the way up and still missed out) and the dark scenes (left me guessing at what we were viewing in some cases) to the predictable but tragic ending, this is not something that I'd recommend.Spend your money on Bound or Chutney Popcorn."
0,My worst purchase ever,"The unit I received was 1/8"" too short for my 80Gb drive. The ISE cable used was too long for the case and the case fastenings were cleap plastic clips not metal screws. The case would not stay together with the drive installed."
1,A powerful venture in American history,"Kelley has produced a powerful and startling history of the deep south in the 1930s. He tackles a difficult subject both historically and ideologically (the relationship between poor black sharecroppers and the American Communist party). His tireless efforts at writing this book shine out of the pages unquestionably as does his deep, thoughtful intelligence. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in subversive U.S. history or just in a good read."
1,Prince of Peace,"John is alive in this video. We envision the man we have put on a pedastal, talking about his daily life and the things important to him. Top notch video!"
1,"No Shock, But This Stick Rocks!","Don't buy this joystick for any type of force feedback, or ""shock"" because it doesn't work. Other than that, this is a great joystick with awesome feel and performance. It's perfectly balanced and was super easy to install for Windows XP-just plug it in!! I got one just like it for my PS2 and that is great too. You can't beat this product for the money!!"
1,Love Jane Nelsen and her approach!,"I love Jane Nelsen's books and her approach - this is an easy read, well layed out, wonderful examples...I highly recommend this book and her follow up books for all parents & caregivers...a wonderfully simple and positive approach to raising children! :)"
1,GREAT CD,"I LOVE THIS I HAVE THE ORINGINAL LP AND HAVE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS , THE EXORCIST BOXED SET CAME WITH A CD BUT DID NOT CONTAIN TUBULAR BELLS, THE VHS BOXED SET."
1,Great Album If you like that 80's style music,I feel that this album takes some getting used to if you have never heard it before it may have sounded better in 1984 but with the techno stuff thats out there today it is a little weak. I do think that the first 5 tracks are great but the rest of the album tends to sound a little plain. I think if Roger were to remake this album with some of the sounds that he used on Electric Fire it would rank up there with his greatest yet.
1,One of their best yet,"I own almost every Cafe Del Mar - and this has to be one of their best yet! More low tempo chill out than someof their others. Creative mix of Spanish and French vocals and some without vocals. Great driving music, or background dinner party music. So relaxing ---but not too much. would make a great gift to introduce someone to this type of music."
