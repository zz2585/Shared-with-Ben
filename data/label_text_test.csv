1,She lived???!!!,"I can't believe that girl Sharon lived!!!! Sorry to spoil it for all you who didnt read it yet. All I have to say is that she better die in part two. I'm waiting! But on the real, this book is tight. I love the way the whole thing went down. That TJ was a wild man! I love him. The people in the book are so real. I was going through it with them. Sign me up for the next one cause I know its gonna be hot!"
0,Be aware that this strategy does not work!,"This book is about low-correlation asset class investing. This strategy is deeply flawed, and was seriously damaged in the 2008 financial melt-down... the very kind of thing that this strategy was supposed to protect against. The reason was very simple: Most asset classes correlated and plunged together, except bonds and precious metals."
0,Not a do-it-yourself book,A book of very expensive houses in island settings with very expensive island style furnihings. It is not at all helpful to those looking to do their own homes in an island style. The pictures are nice to dream about.
0,Cheap item,Item melted when flipping eggs. Edges got worn and very difficult to clean. Does not work like non-stick cookware that's available.
0,Are you looking for truth? Look elsewhere...,"This book contains many half-truths and inaccuracies. This is not a ""conservative"" review, but is a review written by a Roman Catholic, loyal to the teachings of the Church. ""The truth is true whether everyone believes it, or if no one believes it"""
0,Doesn't heat oil to correct temperature,"This is the second fryer we have purchased, and we are sorry we did. We had a DeLonghi that we really liked, but got tired of the clean up, so decided to give this one a try. Even after preheating for over 15 minutes at the highest temperature, the temperature of the oil never gets high enough to correctly fry the food. (I used a cooking thermometer to test the temperature on several different occasions; even after the 15 minute preheat, the temp. was at least 20 degrees too low. As every good fryer knows, correct temperature is key to great fried foods.) Everything comes out a bit soggy, and just doesn't have that great ""fried flavor."" We have used this fryer 5 or 6 times, and now it's headed for the trash can."
0,Don't waste your rental money.................................,"because I couldn't wait for it to be over! Horrible acting, I mean every character was 1 dimensional and had no emotion whatsoever. The movie reminded me of Pumpkinhead but much much worse. The only reason I gave this movie a chance was because Lions Gate had it's Brand on it and I love Lions Gate flicks (most of em). The lead actress (the park Ranger or whatever lady) was just horrible. Her lines were so f'n cheesy and she delivered them even cheesier that it was unbearable to listen to her. I hope she never ""acts"" again. If this movie comes on tv, give it a shot but it's time you will never get back!!"
0,"Moved to tears by this book, a heirloom forever","Alice in Agony is an insperational introduction to the beauty of soap opras. This book requires an ability to read, but no other mental capabilitys. This is definatly fodder for the dog. Bronze this book, don't read it. A fine book for pressing flowers, a door stop, and a fly swatter. Theres is in no plot, no point, or any charactars, but I did like the type and the name of the publisher."
1,Iranian politics made simple,"Using the hostage taking of 1979 as a nucleus Mark Bowden is able to relate pre revolution Iranian history with the overthrow of Reza Palavi, Hatred of the US, return of Khomeni and the downward spiral that crushed the hopes of millions of educated Iranians... for now."
1,Great story!!!,This is a great story told without ethnic bias. The author helps us understand the cultural differences that led to the near extinction of the bison as well as the native peoples that depended upon them. The author does not take sides but presents the differences through the eyes of his characters via a well told tale that will keep you reading past bed time.
0,another load from microsoft,"lies lies xp is not stable and it crashes at the same rate as win- me its obvious that microsoft dident try hard. The meaning of a new release is supposed to be better and go forward, with xp it just went backwards, by far 2000 pro was better. It seems that xp just sacraficed stability, power, and function for a nicer image. I mean it's nice to have a fresh look and good media player but the power that allows you to do anything is...uhh . Xp install is a pain in the but, With problems I dont have room in this form to mention.Over all i'd say just go with win 2000 pro, but if you just want to leave microsoft's bs and want 100x more power 0 viruses 0 total system crashes and more functional software go linux a FUNCTIONAL open source os."
1,AWESOME BOOK MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!,"In Things Not Seen you will find out the adventures of being invisible. Some would think being invisible is an astounding gift, but Bobby Phillips thinks different. Bobby got out of the shower and all of a sudden he looked in the he couldn't see him-self in the mirror. He was invisible. Invisible . . . . Read this book as you continue to find out whom Bobby meets, and how he deals with being invisible. I absolutely thought this was an astounding book. It is truly one of the best books I've ever read."
0,Das Boot is better,"As it stands, this movie is not bad.But, if you have ever watched Das Boot, you will probably agree that this movie is two things:1. Inferior2. The same thing, more or less.I mean, there are differences, mainly the sub here is nuclear (or nucular in Bush-speak), but there are several things that make this movie inferior:* it came after Das Boot, reflecting Hollywood's lack of creativity.* Harrison Ford's Russian accent [is bad].* The language is English, whereas my fav. Das Boot release is the original German with subtitles.* The main actors don't even look Russian for the most part.There were certain scenes where I noticed a very obvious duplication of Das Boot scenes. All in all I consider this a waste of money... I should have purchased a Das Boot DVD instead of renting this one."
0,This isn't Cosmic Wheels!,"OK, the title cut is here, but where is the rest of the original album? I wasn't expecting yet another compilation album!"
1,Love It,Have been using this cologne for years. Not much on wearing perfume but have always enjoyed this light and unusual fragrance. Actually refreshing especially in the hot summer. Wish the scent lasted longer on my skin.
1,Never bored!!!,"We got this car as a gift for our daughter's 1st b-day and have used it just about everyday since - including in the basement! She loves riding up and down the street in it and dancing to the music on the radio!Our only compaint is the assembly of the handle was difficult to install (especiall for a non-handy daddy!!!) and the only way we can push it is to lean it back a little, it makes for steering hard, but our daughter doesn't seemed bothered by it and that is all that matters.She even jsut sits in it when we are too tired to keep pushing her in it. She is now 2 and we jsut took out the bottom so she can stick her feet through and she loves to walk around like the flintstones in the yard and push her dolls in it! This is a must have for any toddler!!!!! Now that she can walk though, we can't get the handle back out...it just sticks out the top. No biggie though."
1,A Little Spooky; A Lot of Fun,This is a perfect book for children just learning about Halloween. Children do like to see that scary things can turn out all right. The mouse in this story is adorable and the perfect character for children to relate to at Halloween.
0,Cradle of Saturn is stillborn,"Science Fiction is, by the very title, supposed to have at least a bit of real science to it, and James Hogan usually lives up to that custom rather well. In this book, however, he disinters the hoariest of pseudoscience, that of Immanuel Velikovsy, who in a series of truly awful best-sellers several decades ago sent planets ricocheting around the solar system rather like billiard balls, thereby accounting for all sorts of ancient history. As a practicing geologist, I found ""Cradle of Saturn"" to violate everything we know to be true about earth history, and to be preachy and righteous about it to boot. I found I could not enjoy the story when the background was so profoundly antiscience and factually incorrect - suspension of disbelief was quite impossible. That said, if you can ignore or even ignore this outer fringe worldview, the story itself was gripping."
1,This is where to start...,"If you consider feeding your dog raw food but need a little ""encouragement"" to make the final move... this is the book. If you are already convinced and need a little ""know-how"" and not the lenghty academics on the subject... this is the book. The author shared her experience in a quick read while sharing a few tricks. So if you don't know if you want to do it, start here!"
0,No breathing room,"I bought this nightgown for use after I had my baby, thinking it would be convenient and cool at night. The material is cheap feeling and doesn't breathe. I ended up sweating so much I switched to white v-neck cotton t-shirts."
0,I believe they gave their best but...,"...this DVD proves it's really impossible to put all the complexity of Dune on screen. Just watching it you will never know how powerful Jessica is. Where is Tuffir Hawat? -- that guy isn't he. Many important details were cut out, such as the secret Bene Gesserit message Lady Fenring left for Jessica. And so on. The special effects are poor; take a look at the Maud'dib rat of the desert -- they took it from the Muppets Show!Please don't give up reading the book because of the bad impression the DVD might give you."
0,I am sorry I did not read review first....,...and so is my seven year old son (who loves animals and creating characters and animals). The graphics seemed ripped out of the 80's. The gameplay was boring and uninspired. The animal customization (which is what drew us to this game) was very nil. Characteristics like 'needs love' or 'likes sound' is not my idea of animal customization. We downlaoded a trial version of 'Zoo vet' which appears far superior.
1,Superb,This is a superbly done CD. Pianist and euphonium player work great together. Listen to the nuances in phrasing in the Bach. Pianist is every bit as superb as the euphonium soloist. Bravo!!!
0,Duped and Disappointed,"Don't waste your money on this slow moving, dismal comedy. Big name actors and a defibrillator couldn't bring this ""comedy"" to life. The biggest disappointment of all was popping it into the DVD player, pushing play and hearing the voice of Alec Baldwin coming through the speakers. Never would I have spent my hard earned AMERICAN money on a film that employed this America-hating, so-called actor who should have left the country long ago."
1,Excellent Service for an Obscure Product,"I was delighted to find a used CD with music from the ""Thang Long Water Puppet Theater"" in Hanoi, Vietnam. Yes, this is an obscure collection of music. It not only arrived (via US mail) quickly but it was also in mint condition. I would highly recommmend the services of Timbuktunes on Amazon Marketplace. Thanks for saving me a return trip to Vietnam to pick up this unique CD!TK"
1,Performance and audio/video are good but production suffers.,"This is a must have for us Steely Dan fans but I have 2 gripes with the production: 1. Misc. interviews are between every song. Using chapter skip on your remote will take you to the start of the next song but gets to be a hassle. Why didn't they just bundle the documentaries seperate from the concert? 2. Certain passages during the concert don't sync with the audio. Some are barely noticeable while others are painfully obvious. Why, or how this was overlooked by the production/QA folks who put this together baffles me. Overall, a good job by Becker, Fagen and Co."
0,"Really, Really, Really, Really bad","This is the worst cd I've ever heard. It is incredibly boring and has no lyrical content. The only, good, uptempo song on the entire cd is ""maybe I'm Amazed"", which is paul McCartney's best song over his entire carrer. I would have give this album NO STARS if it wasn't for that song. The SIX INSTUMENTALS add to the boredom of this album. The cd does have some musical depth but its way too boring to hold your interest. I recomend this album to anyone who suffers from insomnia.After listening to this you realize that John Lennon really was the talent behind the Beatles, and that ""McCartney"" was just a pretender to the throne."
0,Rubbish,"Another example of anti-Ukrainian propaganda, once very popular in pro-Soviet circles and amongst their adherents in the West. The Soviets are now gone, hurrah, but their fellow travellers are, alas, still with us. Serious scholarship demonstrates that Ukraine lost more of its people than any other nation in Nazi occupied Europe (to say nothing about losses a decade earlier, during the genocidal Great Famine of 1932-33). Among the millions enslaved or mudered by the Nazis were many Ukrainian nationalists of the OUN and UPA, more than a few of whom were destroyed in the infamous concentration camps, like Auschwitz. Indeed the two brothers of Stepan Bandera, the OUN leader, both died there. The Ukrainian nationalists were not pro-Nazi, although there are obviously still those who would like the world to think that."
1,Polaroid 600 Film,"The film was shipped with a disclaimer stating that the quality of the product may be compromised due to its age, but in fact, it's performance was highly satisfactory."
1,great for snorers,2 tablets before bedtime seem to clear my allergic rhinitis so that snoring is not a problem! I am so pleased.
0,Too much gags turn the picture boring,"I expected a fun movie but the number of gags are so many and so exagerated that I was bored after thye first half hour.It is not funny, it turned ridiculous!I would not recommend this film to anyone."
1,Victorinox Swiss Army Rally Pocket Knife,I purchased two of these knives for gifts. They are very small and will not take up very much space in one's pants pocket. It is hard to beat the quality of Swiss Army Knife products.
0,We are forced to watch three trailers? No thanks,"When you insert the disc, you are forced to watch three trailers. I hit every button on my remote to skip them, but after reading the many other complaints on here I took the disc out and returned it to Blockbuster without watching.Do no buy, or watch as you are giving in to the movie industry."
0,Doesn't lather and leaves a residue,"Sorry, but I'll have to disagree with the other reviewers. Maybe they were talking about other Hartz dog shampoos, but their Groomer's Best Puppy shampoo is horrible.It produces little to no lather no matter how much you use. Then even after rinsing more than 10 minutes, my silkly terriers hair was far from silky and had a dirty feeling.I'm guessing that to make it gentle they left out the cleaning agents needed for the squeaky clean I look for when bathing my doggy."
0,"Great series, terrible ending","I was very excited about reading this series, i'll admit that the reasons for this are that the writers are Australian(like me) and i heard they will be writing sequels to the original Star Wars movies. But i digress. I loved the first two books and the third was just as exciting and at times thought provoking. The let down was the terrible ending. Sure, I can see the big point being made and it caused me think about that point for and hour or so, but the whole direction of the series took a dramatic turn at the end. There was a totally different feel to the last 5 or 10 pages of A Dark Imbalance, it felt like the ending to another novel, like it had been tacked on. What a shame."
0,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","The author is a researcher at the University of Belgrade, and seems unable to extricate himself from the intellectual constraints of his position. The first half of the book deals with `self-management' and the bureaucratization of the Communist Party: valid themes, no doubt, but hardly key elements of an explanation of the war. When he finally turns to the break-up of Yugoslavia, he begins with a grossly Serb-nationalist account of the Kosovo question; thereafter all blame is placed on Slovenes, Croats, etc."
0,Horrible item!,"This fan makes a lot of noise, but produces little air. I bought this for a friend to use and I feel as though I wasted my money. Do not buy this product"
1,A rock solid debut!,"In Tommy Cutter's spectacular debut, it reads like a screenplay for ""Scream"" or ""I know what you did last summer""; suspenseful and a gripping white-knuckle read.The characters could have been fleshed out a little better, which would have made the book a bit longer than 168 pages; probably the only real negative thing I can say about the book.It was an interesting story about six medical students who study for and dissect a dead body that doesn't appreciate being cut open.As each part of the body gets cut, a student dies in a similar way.Soon the body count gets pretty high and only three people are left.I absolutely loved the way this book read; like a movie was unfolding in my brain as I gobbled it up. I do believe Tommy Cutter will receive a publishing contract from one of the major publication house's and then sell the movie rights.Kudos Mr Cutter, you keep us self-publishing writers hope and the chance to dream big!"
0,Definitely could be better,"D. Wardlow is absolutely right. I couldn't have said it better.Very difficult to turn water tank after filling and not having a flat surface to stand on....besides unless you have a utility water basin, you would probably have to use the bath tub to fill the large tank. Then it's really difficult.I tested about how long before needing a filling and it was completely bone dry in 2 nights (16 hrs). The shutoff valve never shut off when empty.Be careful to buy this unit if you have any back problems because your not going to have fun filling tank every night."
0,"Great potential, disappointing result","I've been a big fan of Peter Jenkins since he first published ""A Walk Across America"" but I was really disappointed by ""Looking For Alaska"". In the ensuing years Jenkins seems to have lost his storytelling style that made me really love his earlier works. ""Looking For Alaska"" is disjointed and choppy and doesn't do justice to the wonderful state of Alaska and its' people."
1,Dressed to kill,"Praise God, this is the book that you need to get if you know that Jesus is your Lord and your Redeemer. 'Dressed to kill' is a must, to be read by all. It specifies in details our warfare with the enemy and how we are prepared to take him out completely once we have Jesus in us.Be blessed as you read this book.Samuel."
0,Don't Get Burned!,"Having had good luck with Calphalon branded 'hot pads', we ordered this item to use while bar-b-quing.WOW! It provided little if any heat protection, resulting in a near burn. A repeat attempt to useit (by another person who had not witnessed the first incident) produced the same surprising result.This product has to be considered dangerous for handling anything really hot. To use the ConsumerReports terms, we rate it Unacceptable."
1,Gives a historical example to drive the points,I used this book among others in the class that I teach in College. This book gives you some real life examples of what others have done that works or didn't work on the topic of public speaking. It offers many guides on the topic and one of the best features is the 1 - 2 page summary at the end of each chapter.
0,Poor quality shoe.,"I had a similar version of this shoe from about 3 years ago that lasted, surprise, 3 years. I bought a pair of these things as replacements... I should have went with my initial instinct. The leather is cheap, the rubber leaves marks on floors, the seams are already busting apart! I walk maybe 1-2 miles a day to work and back and the treads are already wearing thin. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone, what happened to the quality Steve Madden shoe that I used to adore?"
0,Don't bother,"You could make your own! I bought these through a catalog for my 3 year-old last Christmas. He pretends they are leaf-blowers. If you find the ""sweet spot"", the tones are okay, but finding that spot isn't easy. Too much money for not-enough product."
0,This file is corrupted. The last third of it is unplayable.,"Don't even bother with this episode. The file is corrupted, and you will be left hanging. It wasn't that good anyway; just skip it and go to the next."
0,I wanted to like it...,"DD and GA are always great together, but the story line is too silly. C'mon, a head transplant? GMAB! End"
1,TERRIFIC BOOK--AND FINALLY SOME TRUTH...,"about this miserable administration and the buffoon at the top. Also these pompous asses like limbaugh and O'reilly. Just because they have the forum doesn't make their opinions any more important than when they were spouting them off drunk at the bar. Thanks Al Franken for having the guts to expose the hypocrisy and lies of the right-wing. It's about time someone spoke up!That idiot bush has to go...I'll probably be visited now by the ""department of homeland security""....."
1,Insights from the world's greatest manager,"Jack Welch's style of writing is exactly the same as his style of operating: straight from the gut. A big book, yet no ""lard"", this is a surprisingly easy book to read..I did not expect a book of this size and subject to be as easy to understand as this actually turned out to be. Remember finishing the entire book in a span of just over 24 hours on a journey...If you have heard about GE and the GE way, and have wondered what it's all about, then this book is for you. Go for it!"
0,Many Errors,"I ordered this book as a requirement for a class. However, we ended up using the 5th edition because the newer 6th edition had way too many error (ex: 6 on a page) and almost every page had errors. Maybe this edition would be good for someone who already knows how to do nomenclature and just wants extra practice problems."
1,Very useful anatomy book.,This book has very useful drawings for studying anatomy and the motor points. I found it very helpful for learning some of the finer points of anatomy.
0,I don't get it?,"After reading all reviews about how great this CD was, it seemed a logical choice to go ahead and get it. Plus, I had heard We Three Kings on the radio and really liked it. But I gotta tell ya, that song was the high water mark. A couple of others are ok (anything from the Messiah is a plus) but not anything that would make me quickly hit the replay button. What turns so many folks on about this CD? It reminds me of listening to a Jr High School Choir.Certaining not one of my top Christmas CDs. It will probably find its way to the back wall of my CD case...to be played but some unsuspecting first time listener."
0,Crackle Hiss Pop,"Terrible sound quality. After all, it is music and it is suppose to sound good but it doesn't. It must have been wonderful attending this event but the recording is like watching a 1950's TV show."
1,A realistic look,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I didn't find it sensationalized, tabloid-like, or anything like that. It was a readable real life look at what life is like for inmates, staff, and administrators. It is not written to invoke sympathy for the inmates, but it does provide food for thought as to their point of view. It also does not attempt to justify the guards' attitudes, but merely to explain them. It is then up to the reader to put it all together, and decide for himself or herself what the truth is about life in America's correctional system. A worthwhile book which I recommend."
0,I don't know yet,I don't know yet because I haven't been able to put the bike together! It is very frustrating because I don't have the tools (and the instructions are not at all well written). Now I have to take it in a friend's truck to a mechanic and pay for them to put it together. Not happy.
1,It's their first album and Davy is in front!!!,"This record has some more of Davy's songs that I like to listen to, and it has a good sound to it. Now I have both the cd and record of this album. Happy listening!!"
1,The best Disney Encyclopedia EVER!!!,"The Disney A-Z Encyclopedia is one of the best encylopedia books ever! It tells about different shows you watched on TV when you were little; the famous places at the Disney theme parks that no longer exists, and your favorite Disney characters!"
0,COHEN BROTHERS?,"Cohen brothers, not to be confused with Coen brothers. This fine Zombie production, shot in super VHS starts out with the character build-up of our three main characters. Cody (Jason McClain) is our cocky bike rider. Tom (Dave Competello) is his boss at his day job and bike mechanic. Lori (Rachel Diana) is a groupie and girlfriend to Cody.While racing they encounter motocross zombies from hell who target them for death. Fortunately our team are second amendment enthusiasts, without which we would surely succumb to zombie infestations.The film is bad on all levels. Just when you think it is getting into gear, they run the credits. The acting, plot, and dialouge are all horrendous. Only one real zombie special effects, the other zombies are smart enough to wear helmets. I can't recommend even for camp value.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, no nudity."
1,I Love This Little Mouse,"For me, the best thing ever invented. I can sit anywhere with my laptop and my mouse is by my side; it works on any surface; no more hand cramps from using my touch-pad laptop mouse. Its comfortable, even if you have large hands. It's much easier to edit long research papers on my laptop; this mouse is very precise in placement and easy to control.If you are still using optical you don't know what you are missing."
1,GrEaT CD,"I think this is a very good c.d. My favorite songs are Wasting My Life, the LFO song, and the Smash Mouth song. All of the songs are really good though. I personally thought the movie was great and its one of my favorites, so I definetly would recomend this c.d."
0,spartina muck,Having grown up in Rhode Island I was initially fascinated by many familiar references and the development of the main character. But then gradually the story became infinitely less interesting for a variety of reasons. It is unfortunate as it had great potential but seemingly got as lost as a worm in spartina muck.
0,Fossil Men's Watch #AM3878,"Very nice looking watch, except it's too large - unless you like large watches."
1,A Great Surprise,"Although I never followed American Idol, I heard stories about it on the news. As soon as I head the song Miss Independent I went and bought the cd. What a pleasant surprise. This cd is great. Although some songs should have been left out, there are other great ones. These are: The Trouble with Love is, Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed the Train, Beautiful Disaster and Anytime (this one being my favorite). Buy this cd if you love pop music. You won't be dissapointed."
0,Poor design,"A poorly conceived design. The pieces do not fit inside the attached storage compartment. Buy someone else's design. Great game that teaches great logic...but why do we keep designing products that break, fall apart, do not store well, etc?!"
1,"Good, but could be better.","My biggest complaint with this desk was the god awful instructions. I have put together my share of furniture and this was by far the worse. It works good for small spaces, which is what i was wanting. Had to brace it up due to my printer shaking quite a bit. Not a bad desk , if you can get through the instructions."
1,This is a wonderful book - a classic.,"Everyone should have a copy of this book on theirbookshelves. I'm on my second copy - the first onefell apart due to daily use. It's a terrificresource for vegetable recipes - some of thembeautifully photographed. If you're lucky enoughto have a vegetable garden, this book is full ofinformation about growing vegetables, as well ascooking them. Marian knows her vegetables and haswonderful ideas for new and unusual ways to cookthem."

0,Smelled of smoke,"This humidifier really is easy to use, fill, and clean. However, within the first week of owning it, using it according to directions, it smelled as if it were smoking/burning. It did this on two separate occasions. It really smelled as if the motor would catch fire. I returned it and won't be buying another one."

0,On Globalistan,"Pepe Escobar's Globalistan is, in the author's words, ""a warped geopolitical travel book"" that aims to transform and politicize the reader's understanding of the interrelated processes which facilitate and perpetuate ""globalization, energy wars and the Pentagon's Long War."" The text, as much a work of abstract political theory as it is reportage, is a brief but overly complicated polemic that ultimately fails to present a practical alternative to the world views and socio-economic practices which the author clearly set out to challenge. The literary and theoretical references and allusions which riddle the text are sure to interest some (myself included), but Escobar's awkward phraseology and penchant for abstraction-for-the-sake-of-abstraction can at times be distracting. Ultimately, the book may be of value to students of sociology, political science and heterodox economics, but it is almost certain to tire and/or bore the average and relatively apolitical reader."
0,Complete Garbage,"This game has been active for over 2 years. The game since launch still has over thousands of bugs. They recently did 2 huge game re-vamps. The first one was the start of the fall of the game. Massive amounts of players left the game during the first revamp and now this second revamp that just occured caused everyone in the game to leave. This is a MMO and there is no one to play with online since everyone quit. The game is unplayable due to bugs, no content, the professions are broke and unbalanced. It's a waste of money buying this game. I rather play ToonLand Online. That game is more fun."
1,This book is a fantastic read...,"I was fortunate enough to buy this book for a dollar at a library sale. What a buy! I can't put the book down. A well written and interesting story. I hope to find more books written by her. She is as good a writer as Ann Rice, actually better.She would be a natural to write a trilogy of some sort. I look forward to more books by Benson, this time I will pay full price."
1,it works,"got this about a year ago. HD picture looks fantastic on my panasonic viera plasma. i just have the built-in speakers, but they sound good too. i do have to have the antenna in the window, pointed in a very specific direction, otherwise i don't get certain channels. plus i have to have the bunny ears extended all the way. so if you don't want to have to look at the thing, you should probably get an external antenna. otherwise this one provides great picture, once you get it pointed in the right direction..."
1,The strongest of energy levels - a dancing bonanza!,This single is the rage in Asia! I recenlty returned from a trip through Thailand and from Bangkok to Phuket this tune was everywear. A strong and positive influence of energy and a sexy dash of lyrics combine to make this tune a must for any club enthusiast! Good to see it is also available home is the states when I got back!
1,FANTASTIC Skewers for Kebobs,"These are fantastic. Because of the shape of the skewer, flat, it doesn't roll on your grill. Your food turns and stays turned easily. The tips can be sharpened ~ I don't sharpen them because I am concerned about how sharp they can actually become. Instead, I slit the meat or veggie with a small sharp knife and thread them onto the skewer. You can't use small pieces of meat or veggies ~ the width of the skewer is almost a half an inch. They are about 18 inches in length, but you lose almost 2 inches because of the ""handle"" ~ You can easily get 16 inches worth of food on this skewer.They wash easily and so far, I've not had any rust issues. These are the BEST skewers available as far as I'm concerned."
0,F-LOCK gets me killed!,"If you like all the bells and whisles then maybe this keyboard is for you... Unforunatly my Key board quit on my one night and i had to run to the story to get a new one. I have been buying Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite for the past 8 years, and was very pleased with how they preform. Yet the store was out of these so i picked up the most smilair board. Poor choice i made. The keys are soft, the board is heavy, the stupid F-Lock is annoying (i'm gamer) and the the color is boring... Never agian i sayStick with the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite - it's cheaper and more efficent"
1,And they have done it again . . .,"It is always difficult to keep a good idea going, but Triloka seems to have done it again. I can hardly wait to scream and dream across the dirt roads of the Great Basins and Ranges on a full moon with this playing and the gravel crunching and clicking. It has that Mid-East/Indian flavor that has it's own kind of trances: the trances of the arid lands - hot or cold, it is still arid -- and that seems to give rise to a certain kind of dream music. If you like the other Trance Planets, you will like this one as well - it is the same kind of ""fusion"" as the others, and of course, if you love the others you won't be disappointed here - the sample cuts on Amazon do give you a good idea of the album so, listen and then dream . . . ."
1,Surprisingly moving book!!,"I saw a copy of this book in a vintage bookstore in Winston Salem. I was drawn to the book because the girl on the front looks like my granddaughter. But as I read the words - my heart began to swell. As I saw ""her"" face in all the different locations - my world view began to increase. I bought a copy for all the little girls in my life and one copy for me."
0,Not legitimate kava,I have had calming effects from taking the now discontinued liquid kava/passiflora/valerian from country life.The Eclectic Institute - Maple Flavored Kava Kavajust left me a little light headed and upset that a company with hundreds of products sold at places like whole foods and amazon.com sells inferior products. At least this one is.
0,Good concept...Bad EULA,"After the '1984' incident, I will surely not recommend this item. Should policies change in the future, then maybe. Until then, stay away!"
0,Don't let the cover and titile entice you - it's awful!,"I was very excited to order this book as I heard rave reviews from critics about Bridget Jones. Let me tell you, I hated the book so much I almost didn't finish it. The character, Bridget, is stupid and pathetic. How anyone could find her amusing is beyond my understanding - her life is sad and she is not using her life to it's best potential. I heard they are making a movie about it - steer clear, no matter what the hype says!!!!!!!"
0,really poor product,"When I purchased this product, the lady at the store said ""be sure you keep your receipt"". That should have been my first clue. After a month now of tea leaking all over the counter even though I try carefully to seat the pitcher near the brewing part of the machine and a couple of burns when I tried to fix it while it was brewing and leaking, I have thrown the piece of junk away. I did keep the pitcher to water my outside plants with although from what I read it is likely to crack given a little more time. I won't even comment on how unsanitary the pitcher looks after one or two uses. A really bad product."
0,Too old but some ok basic concepts,"This book was published in 2001. As such there is no information regarding open fit OTE hearing aids. I also could not find any information regarding cochlear dead regions and the use of hearing aid fitting for patients who may have that problem.If you can find a cheap used copy maybe think about it but overall it is a dated reference. Do an internet search at Hearing Journal, Hearing Review, American Academy of Audiology, or any number of other sites and get better more up to date information then this."
1,Close But No Cigar,"This was a truly amazing book. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars is because it took me a while to get into the flow of it. I believe Christina Schwarz is an extremely talented writer. The way the story is written, it gives all of the characters' point of view. You hear what everyone has to say, whether it is memories or daily life. Some of the characters ask questions that really make you wonder, make you think, if what has been told to you so far in the book is really true. Once I found the flow of the book, I could not put it down. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a creative, slightly twisted, plot."
1,its very cool,"You can play helicopter and boat,skate and car(i think).I love it ,ill will play with my friend in 3 hours.ill love this its 5 stars really .Yeah its cool but my friend hate it but my i love it i want it i twist it i dance it..."
0,VERY VERY VERY BAD,"The game don't work! I load the the game, the screen turns black and the the game quits. I E-Mailed the Tech. Support people, they gave me a bunch of mubo jumbo about pulling files out doing this and that and send them the files, I did not understand a word, and I am good about the Tech. side of computers. And my computer is only 5 months old and well over the system requirements. Do not waste your money!P.S. This game should get no stars, but it wont let me post unless I give it at least one star."
1,EBMUD's Plant Guide is essential,"I've been using this book for about two years in the landscape architecture office I work in, and find it is often the first book I go to when creating a plant list. Very informative, with beautiful color photos of every plant listed (of at least the genus). A must have for Bay Area professionals and residents who care about using location appropriate plants. Complements the Bay Friendly Guidelines and is accepted by Bay Friendly as a resource for sites that require adherence to their policies. I highly recommend it."
0,Cheap product cheaply made,I returned this caliper after I saw how badly made it was. The display was fine but the adjusting knob was wobbly even when tightened. It was a big heavier than I thought it would be. I didn't like using it and would not recommend it.
0,Worked for two months,This was a factory reconditioned unit. It has developed a problem--echos occur when listening to HD stations
1,Bharati Mukherjee interviewed on Fresh Air,"Bharati Mukherjee was interviewed on NPR Fresh Air on April 1, 2002. She gives a fascinating glimpse into her traditional family life in India contrasted with the new life she chose in the United States. In the interview, you will learn such things as after a two week courtship she married a fellow Iowa Writers Workshop student during lunch, upstairs in a lawyer's office, above a coffee shop. They are still married. She speaks with eloquence about topics ranging from arranged marriages, the women's movement, to racial discrimination..."
0,Looks like a great game execpt for the DRM..,"What a lot of people said. The gameplay looks fun, and the graphics are spectacular.. but I'm not a fan of being treated like a criminal just to play their silly game. Imagine if you bought a house and the bank installed a rent-a-cop to follow you around to make sure you paid the mortgage.Just icky feeling all around.. I'd avoid this game at all costs until Electronic Arts removes the draconian DRM. The pirates don't use it, why should I pay for it and be saddled with their spyware/DRM?"
0,Big Disappointment,The calculator stopped working after 3 months of use. I am very disappointed in the product and now had to spend more money to replace it with a new one.
1,Excellent,"This book is a beautifully written collection of love notes/poems. Rhonda has given those with otherwise lack of words when it comes to romance, a chance to express themselves. I had the opportunity to meet with Rhonda several times and her personailty as well as her being go hand in hand with this book, i am hoping she will bless us with another.A fan at MDS"
0,Tiresome and annoying,"This, like most rap, is cliche drivel. It is ""audio entertainment"" for people who either 1) don't like actual music 2)who don't know better. Very unlikely to stand the test of time. The hype and gushing surrounding this CD is almost unbelievable until you think ""Hey, people liked Milli Vanilli for a while too."" Trendy garbage."
1,Awesome,"This is a classic. I have read it several times. I love everything about it. Adventure and lots of beards, what else could you ask for? :)"
0,Misadvertised Item,"The heading of this item is a little vague, but the description leads you to believe you're actually purchasing a tripod as it gives all the specs. etc. of the actual tripod. It even states you're saving $80+, which leads you to believe it must be a discontinued item. This is NOT the tripod; it is indeed a handle for a tripod."
0,Not From Original Publisher,Bad DVD quality. Not from original publisher (EROS) as indicated on associated image. Other sellers may have the original of this DVD but Planet Bollywood does not. Have bought other DVD from this sellers and those were fine. My dissatisfaction is with this specific DVDs from this specific seller.
1,Fun gifts your clild can make themselves,"My daughter (4) has made presents for her teachers and her friends with this set. Plenty of letters - could use some more beads, but still, she loves it."
0,If they say so...,"First of all, Stephen King didn't write ""Holloween"" (as the moron who wrote the book review spelled it) and he didn't write Friday The 13th. Did the person who wrote this book even read any of what he's wrote? Or is she just talking out her behind?"
